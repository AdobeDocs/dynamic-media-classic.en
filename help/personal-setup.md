## Browser

* **[!UICONTROL Thumbnail Size]** - Determines the default size of thumbnail images in Grid View in the Browse Panel.

If you are working with large quantities of assets in the Asset Library, you can view the assets by name. For example, if you are building a large eCatalog with many PDF files, you can view the assets by name to make the list shorter.
* **[!UICONTROL Default Browse Sort Order]** - Determines the order in which assets appear by default in the Browse Panel. Choose a sort criterion on the menu and whether you want an ascending or descending sort.
* **[!UICONTROL Default Browse Location]** - Lets you set the browse location to the default, the last folder browsed, or to a specific location that you navigate to and identify. You can also set the browse location to sort the files and folders in ascending or descending order.
* **[!UICONTROL Default Browse View]** - Determines whether Grid View or List View is the default view you see when you first open the Browse panel.
* **[!UICONTROL Splash Screen Display]** - Determines whether you see any splash screens, including the Welcome splash screen.

* **[!UICONTROL Show File Size]** - Displays the file size of an asset when you are browsing.
* **[!UICONTROL Include UDFs in Search]** - To improve system performance for most metadata searches that you run, deselected (default).

  See [Conducting an advanced search](searching-assets.md#conducting_an_advanced_search).

  See also [User-Defined Fields](application-setup.md#user_defined_fields).

* **[!UICONTROL Basic Search Type]** - You can select from two options: **[!UICONTROL Contains]** searches the full string for the specified value; **[!UICONTROL StartsWith]** searches from the beginning of the string and returns results faster than **[!UICONTROL Contains]**. Either option overrides the default that is set in **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Application Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Application General Settings]** by the Administrator.
* **[!UICONTROL Show Command Feedback]** - Select to turn the display of command requests to the server on; deselect to turn off.
