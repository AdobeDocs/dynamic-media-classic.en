# Quick Start: Swatch Sets{#quick-start-swatch-sets}

Dynamic Media Classic Swatch Sets give users an integrated viewing experience. In the dynamic Swatch Set Viewer, users can see an item rendered in a different color, material, texture, finish, or fabric merely by clicking a thumbnail.

This Swatch Sets Quick Start is designed to get up and running quickly with Swatch Set techniques in Dynamic Media Classic.

## 1. Uploading the images and swatch files

Start by uploading the images and swatch files for your Swatch Sets.

On the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to upload files from your computer to a folder on Dynamic Media Classic. See [Preparing Swatch Set assets for upload](preparing-swatch-set-assets-upload.md#preparing-swatch-set-assets-for-upload) and [Uploading your files](uploading-files.md#uploading-your-files).

## 2. Creating a Swatch Set

To create a Swatch Set, on the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Build]** > **[!UICONTROL Swatch Sets]**. On the Swatch Set page, drag images, and color swatches onto the page. See [Creating a Swatch Set](creating-swatch-set.md#creating-a-swatch-set).

## 3. Setting up Swatch Set Viewer Presets

Administrators can create or modify Image Set Viewer Presets. Dynamic Media Classic comes with default Viewer Presets for each rich media type. Use the Zoom Viewer: Custom > Image Sets/Color Swatches presets to view your Swatch Sets.

See [Creating and editing Viewer Presets](application-setup.md#adding-and-editing-viewer-presets).

## 4. Previewing a Swatch Set

Select the Swatch Set in the Browse Panel, and then click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**. Your Swatch Set appears in this page. Click the thumbnail and swatch icons so you can examine your Swatch Set in the selected Viewer. You can choose different Viewers from the Presets menu.

See [Previewing an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing-an-asset).

## 5. Publishing a Swatch Set

Publishing a Swatch Set places it on Dynamic Media Classic servers and activates the URL string.

Click the **[!UICONTROL Mark For Publish]** icon to the left of its name in the Browse Panel. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**. On the Publish page, click **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.

See [Publishing](publishing-files.md#publishing-files).

## 6. Linking a Swatch Set to a web page

Dynamic Media Classic creates URL calls for Swatch Sets, and activates them after you publish. You can copy these URLs from the Preview page.

Select the Swatch Set, and then select the Preview button. The Preview page opens. Select a Swatch Set Viewer Preset and select the Copy URL button. See [Linking a Swatch Set to a web page](linking-swatch-set-web-page.md#linking-a-swatch-set-to-a-web-page).
