# Disable Adobe Analytics tracking{#disabling-adobe-analytics-tracking}

**To disable Adobe Analytics tracking:**

1. Turn off all events in the Adobe Analytics Configuration page in Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.
1. Save and publish.

These steps turn off the support through Adobe Dynamic Media Classic and through URLs obtained from the **[!UICONTROL CopyURL]** feature. If you implement custom tracking, disable the Adobe Analytics tracking as setup in the Configuration page to prevent conflicts with the custom implementation.
