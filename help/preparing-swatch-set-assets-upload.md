# Preparing Swatch Set assets for upload{#preparing-swatch-set-assets-for-upload}

Before uploading the images you need, make sure that the images are the right size and format. Also assemble the swatch files you need.

To create a Swatch Set, you need vignettes or different shots of the same image showing it in different colors, patterns, or finishes. You also need swatch files that correspond to the different colors, patterns, or finishes. For example, to present a Swatch Set showing the same jacket in black, brown, and green, you need:

* A black, brown, and green shot of the same jacket.
* A black, brown, and green color swatch.

Because users can zoom images in Swatch Sets, make sure that the images are at least 2000 pixels in the largest dimension. Scene7 supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended.

For detailed instructions on uploading assets, see [Uploading files](uploading-files.md#uploading_files).
