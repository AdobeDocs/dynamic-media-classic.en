# Quick Start: Zoom{#quick-start-zoom}

 Zoom lets you interactively view high-resolution details in images. For example, you can see the colors, options, angles, and details of an image in a dynamic, fully configurable, integrated viewer. This viewer can be embedded on a web page or appear in a pop-up window. You can inspect images at close range and pan images at high resolutions to examine them closely. Zooming gives your clients an engaging, informative, and interactive viewing experience.

Dynamic Media Classic also offers guided zooming—a means for you to highlight the important features in an image. For example, to focus the attention of viewers on a logo, you can create a zoom target for the logo. When viewers click this zoom target, they zoom to the logo.

All zoom images are created and served from single master images, graphics, and database-driven attributes. Dynamic Media Classic zooming greatly reduces the time and cost of producing and delivering images. You can use Zoom Viewers to zoom in and out of images. The Zoom Viewer has buttons that you can click to zoom and pan; you can also pan by dragging onscreen. Using Zoom Viewer Presets, you can configure the Zoom Viewer in which you zoom images.

**Quick Start**

This Zoom Quick Start is designed to get up and running quickly with Zoom techniques in Dynamic Media Classic. Follow steps 1 through 6. After each step is a cross-reference to a topic heading where you can find more information.

**1. Uploading zoom Images**

Start by uploading your zoom images to Dynamic Media Classic. For optimal zooming, Dynamic Media Classic recommends that the images are at least 2000 pixels in the longest dimension.

Select the Upload button on the Global Navigation bar to upload images from your computer or network to a folder on Dynamic Media Classic. See [Uploading zoom images](uploading-zoom-images.md#uploading_zoom_images).

**2. Creating zoom targets for guided zooming**

Zoom targets present a way for you to highlight specific parts of an image. For example, you can direct attention to the parts of an image that make it unique or distinctive. In the Zoom Viewer window, zoom targets appear in the form of thumbnail images to the side of the image. Selecting one of these zoom target thumbnails automatically zooms to a part of the image that you specify.

To create a zoom target, click the rollover Edit button and choose Zoom Targets, or open an image in the Browse Panel in Detail view and click Zoom Targets. Then use the Zoom tools on the Zoom Target Editor screen to isolate part of the image as a target. See [Creating zoom targets for Guided Zoom](creating-zoom-targets-guided-zoom.md#creating_zoom_targets_for_guided_zoom).

**3. Setting up Zoom Viewer Presets**

Zoom Viewer Presets determine the style and behavior of your Zoom Viewers. You can set up Zoom Viewer Presets if you are an administrator; Dynamic Media Classic comes with default “best practice” Zoom Viewer Presets as well.

To create a Zoom Viewer Preset, click the Setup button on the Global Navigation bar and choose Viewer Presets. Then click the Add button in the Viewer Presets screen, choose a platform, choose a Zoom Viewer, and click Add. Then choose options on the Configure Viewer screen.

Dynamic Media Classic offers Zoom Viewer Preset options that enable you to select the button style and overall look of the viewer. You can also customize the zoom settings for your web site. See [Setting up Zoom Viewer Presets](setting-zoom-viewer-presets.md#setting_up_zoom_viewer_presets).

**4. Previewing images with the Zoom Viewer**

You can preview images in a Zoom Viewer to see what the zooming experience is when images are zoomed.

To explore different Zoom Viewer Presets and how they present the zooming experience, select an image in the Browse Panel and click the Preview button. The Preview screen opens. Choose Presets > Zoom, and then select a preset with the Zoom menus.

Zoom buttons appear. You can see what the zoom images look like on your web site. Select the Zoom buttons (and zoom targets) to test the settings of the Zoom Viewer Preset you chose. See [Previewing images with different Zoom Viewers](previewing-image-assets-different-zoom.md#previewing_image_assets_with_different_zoom_viewers).

**5. Publishing zoom images**

Publishing your zoom images places them on Dynamic Media Image Servers so that they can be delivered to your web site and application. As part of the publishing process, Dynamic Media Classic activates URL strings. These URL strings call zoom images from Dynamic Media Image Servers to your web site or application.

Select the Publish button on the Global Navigation bar to initiate a publish. On the Publish screen, select the Start Publish button. See [Publishing zoom images](publishing-zoom-images.md#publishing_zoom_images).

**6. Linking Zoom Viewers to your web page**

Dynamic Media Classic creates the URL callout strings necessary for zooming images, and activates them when you publish images to Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can copy these URL strings from the Preview screen. After you copy the URL strings, they are available to your web sites and applications. See [Linking Zoom Viewers to your web page](linking-zoom-viewers-web-pages.md#linking_zoom_viewers_to_your_web_pages).
