## Adding Swatch Set URLs to your web page {#adding-swatch-set-urls-to-your-web-page}

The most common way to deploy Swatch Sets is to place a link (via a navigation icon) on your web page. When clicked, the link launches a dynamic page (ASP or JSP) that displays the Swatch Set in a pop-up zoom window. The zoom link opens a pop-up window that contains the actual zoom feature.
