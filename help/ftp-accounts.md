# Managing FTP accounts{#managing-ftp-accounts}

Only Media Portal Administrators can administer and manage FTP accounts. In addition, only users with the role of *Media Portal Contributor-User *or *Media Portal Contributor* can upload digital assets.

Remember that you can activate or deactivate existing Media Portal users by way of the User Administration page in Administration Setup.

See [Activating or deactivating users](administration-setup.md#activating_or_deactivating_users).

1. Click **Setup** > **Media Portal** > **FTP Accounts**.
1. On the Add FTP Account page, in the FTP Accounts Username drop-list, select a user.

   If a user is not listed, you may need to first add them as a Media Portal Admin, a Media Portal Contributor-User, or a Media Portal Contributor by way of Administration Setup. After you add the user with the proper role, their user name is available from the drop-down list.

   See [Adding a Media Portal user](adding-media-portal-users.md#adding_a_media_portal_user).

1. In the Password and Confirm fields, type the password to the FTP account.
1. Click **Save** to add the account to the Existing Accounts table.

   To upload media assets, you need the FTP Account Username that is listed in the Existing Accounts table, and the password that is assigned to the account.

   See [Uploading files](uploading-files.md#uploading_files).
