# Developer resources{#developer-resources}

Scene7 provides documentation for the latest major version of each Scene7 software module. Module documents are available for Scene7 Image Authoring, the Scene7 Publishing System, Image Server and Image Rendering, Viewers, and Web-to-Print.

Release notes are also available for some modules. Release notes provide details on the release, including enhancements, new functionality, tips, troubleshooting advice, and known outstanding issues. Release notes also offer interactive examples of rich-media features and how to activate them. In addition, Release Notes offer installation and configuration instructions for clients with licensed software.

Reference Guides to Image Serving and Image Rendering, and Viewers describe the http protocols for these server modules. Web site developers who want to further customize and leverage Scene7 rich media for a web site or custom application can use these guides. Scene7 assumes that the reader is familiar with Scene7 Publishing System, general http protocol standards and conventions, and basic imaging terminology.
