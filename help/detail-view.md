# Working in Detail view{#working-in-detail-view}

You can work with and learn about an asset by opening it in Detail view. In Detail view, you see the asset size, attributes, derivatives, and metadata. You also see whether and when the asset was published and obtain the URL of published assets. Depending on the asset type, you can preview it at different sizes, zoom in on it, and perform sharpening, cropping, and other formatting operations.

## Open an asset in Detail view {#open-an-asset-in-detail-view}

To closely examine, preview, or work on an asset, you can display it in Detail view.

1. In the Browse Panel, do one of the following:

    * Double-click the asset.
    * Select the asset, then click **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**.
    * Select the asset, then click **[!UICONTROL File > Details]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can page from asset to asset in the same folder in Detail view by selecting the Previous Asset or Next Asset button. These buttons are located in the upper-right corner in Detail view.

## Getting information in Detail view {#getting-information-in-detail-view}

Detail view provides information about an asset or file. It shows this information about an item: the folder where it is stored, its filename, the date the item was uploaded to Dynamic Media Classic, and its publishing history. You can also view and edit metadata and add keywords for an asset in Detail view.

You can obtain an asset URL in Detail view; however, the URL is not active until you publish the asset. For images, Detail view also provides a list of build and derived assets and metadata, such as zoom targets and Image Sets.

## Working with assets in Detail view {#working-with-assets-in-detail-view}

Detail view offers tools for working with the asset you opened. Which tools are available depends on the type of asset you are working with, but Detail view always offers these functions:

* **items for publish**
Click the **[!UICONTROL Publish]** icon to the left of the name, or click **[!UICONTROL File > Publish]** or **[!UICONTROL File > Unpublish]**.

* **Renaming the asset**
Select the name and enter a new name.

* **Editing and adding metadata**
Select the Metadata panel and make changes as desired. See [Viewing, adding, and exporting metadata](/help/viewing-adding-exporting-metadata.md).

* **Editing and adding keywords**
Select Keywords and add or remove them as desired. See [Add or edit keywords](/help/viewing-adding-exporting-metadata.md).

* **Deleting the asset**
Click **[!UICONTROL File > Delete]**.

For discrete files—images, Image Sets, and fonts, for example—you can view the publishing and editing history, and check job details, in Detail view.
