# Work in Detail View{#working-in-detail-view}

You can work with and learn about an asset by opening it in Detail View. In Detail View, you see the asset size, attributes, derivatives, and metadata. You also see whether and when the asset was published and obtain the URL of published assets. Depending on the asset type, you can preview it at different sizes, zoom in on it, and perform sharpening, cropping, and other formatting operations.

*Detail View with the Asset Library panel hidden from view on the left side.*

>[!NOTE]

>To open the folder where the asset is stored, you can select the folder path at the top of the Information panel.

## Open an asset in Detail View {#open-an-asset-in-detail-view}

To closely examine, preview, or work on an asset, you can display it in Detail View.

1. In the Browse Panel, do any one of the following:

    * Select the asset. Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic, select the **[!UICONTROL Detail View]** icon .
    * Double-click the asset.
    * Select the asset, then go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Details]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can page from asset to asset in the same folder in Detail View by selecting **[!UICONTROL Previous Asset]** or **[!UICONTROL Next Asset]**. These buttons are in the upper-right corner in Detail View.

## Get information in Detail View {#getting-information-in-detail-view}

Detail View provides information about an asset or file. It shows this information about an item: the folder where it is stored, its filename, the date the item was uploaded to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic, and its publishing history. You can also view and edit metadata and add keywords for an asset in Detail View.

You can obtain an asset URL in Detail View; however, the URL is not active until you publish the asset. For images, Detail View also provides a list of build and derived assets and metadata, such as zoom targets and Image Sets.

## Work with assets in Detail View {#working-with-assets-in-detail-view}

Detail View offers tools for working with the asset you opened. Which tools are available depends on the type of asset you are working with, but Detail View always offers these functions:

* **items for publish** - Select the **[!UICONTROL Publish]** icon to the left of the name, or go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Publish]** or **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Unpublish]**.

* **Rename the asset** - Select the name and enter a new name.

* **Edit and add metadata** - Select the Metadata panel and change as desired. See [View, add, and export metadata](/help/viewing-adding-exporting-metadata.md).

* **Edit and add keywords** - Select Keywords and add or remove them as desired. See [Add or edit keywords](/help/viewing-adding-exporting-metadata.md).

* **Delete the asset** - Go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.

For discrete files—images, Image Sets, and fonts, for example—you can view the publishing and editing history, and check job details, in Detail View.
