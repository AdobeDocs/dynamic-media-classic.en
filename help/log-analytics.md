# Log in to Adobe Analytics{#log-in-to-adobe-analytics}

Before you log in to configure Adobe Analytics reports and match Adobe Analytics report variables to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic events, verify that you are a member of the Web Service Access group in Adobe Analytics. Members in this group can access all reports in the specified report suites by way of the Experience Cloudâ€™s Web Services API regardless of the permissions set in the interface. To add a member to the group, in Adobe Analytics, go to **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit Groups]**.

When you log in, you have the option of entering your Experience Cloud Org ID to use the latest video analytics implementation. If you choose not to enter your ID, video reporting still works. However, it can cause the data to not integrate correctly with other data for that client from outside Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your Adobe Analytics account has been migrated to Adobe IMS-based authentication (Identity Management System) for login, entering direct credentials does not work.

**To log in to Adobe Analytics from Adobe Dynamic Media Classic:**

Begin by integrating Dynamic Media Classic with Adobe Analytics OAuth. The Adobe Analytics OAuth integration with Dynamic Media Classic is typically only done once per user.

1. Access [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console). Ensure that your account has administrator permissions for the organization for which the integration is required.
1. Near the upper-right corner of the Home page, from the drop-down list, select the appropriate company. (The screenshot below is for information purposes only; the actual company name you select can vary.)
