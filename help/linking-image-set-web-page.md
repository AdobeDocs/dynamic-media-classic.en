# Linking an Image Set to a web page{#linking-an-image-set-to-a-web-page}

After you publish an Image Set, you can copy its URL or its embed code for use in your web site or application. Then you can deploy the URL or paste the embed code as necessary so users can view the Image Set on your web site or application.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copying an Image Set URL {#copying-an-image-set-url}

1. In the Asset Browse panel, in the Show drop-down list, click **[!UICONTROL Image Set]**.
1. in the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the asset folder that contains the Image Set whose embed code you want to copy.
1. Above the Asset Browse panel, on the right side of the toolbar, do one of the following:

    * Click **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset Browse panel, double-click a single asset to open it in Detail View. In the URLs and Embed Code panel on the right, click **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** to the right of the viewer you want.
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset Browse panel, select a single asset, and then below the thumbnail image, click **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.

      In the Viewer List page, under the Actions column of the table, click **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]**.

    * Click **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset Browse panel, select a single asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, click **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.

## Adding Image Set URLs to your web page {#adding-image-set-urls-to-your-web-page}

The most common way to deploy Image Sets is to place a link (via a navigation icon) on your web page. When clicked, the link launches a dynamic page (JSP) that displays the Image Set in a pop-up zoom window. The zoom link opens a pop-up window that contains the actual zoom feature.
