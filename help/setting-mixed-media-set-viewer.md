# Setting up a Mixed Media Set Viewer Preset{#setting-up-a-mixed-media-set-viewer-preset}

Mixed Media Set Viewer Presets determine the style, behavior, and look of your main viewer. When configuring a preset, you specify which other viewers you want to appear inside the Mixed Media Viewer. For example, if youâ€™ve included an Image Set in your Mixed Media Set, specify an Image Set Viewer Preset for the Mixed Media Set Viewer.

You can choose to include all or some community features in the Mixed Media Set Viewer. The Embed feature adds a link to the viewer that lets users copy the code required to display the viewer in an external page (such as a blog, web site, or social networking site). The Link feature provides the URL to the viewer, so users can link back to this viewer. The Visit feature provides a link to the web site you specify.

1. On the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer Presets]**.
1. On the Viewer Presets page, do one of the following:

    * To create a preset, click **[!UICONTROL Add]**. In the Add Viewer Preset dialog box, choose a platform, choose **[!UICONTROL Mixed Media Set Viewer]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
    * To edit a Mixed Media Set Viewer preset, select it, then click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. On the Configuration Viewer page, type a name in the Preset Name box for the Mixed Media Set Viewer preset.
1. Specify **[!UICONTROL Tabs]** or **[!UICONTROL No Tabs]**. Tabs separate items by type, such as videos, swatches, and spin sets. When you specify no tabs, all items appear in a row under the Preview window.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Name]** box, type a name for the viewer you want to add.

   For example, if you are adding a Swatch Set to your Mixed Media Set, type `Swatch Set A`.

1. From the Viewer menu, choose the type of asset you want to view, such as Swatch Sets. 
1. From the Preset menu, choose a preset for the chosen asset type.

   For example, if you are adding a Swatch Set, choose **[!UICONTROL SwatchSet1-Colors]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

   The new Viewer preset appears in the list.

1. Repeat steps 6 - 9 for all the Viewer presets you want to add.
1. To edit the preset list, do any of the following:

    * To reorder presets in the list, select a preset, and the click the blue **[!UICONTROL Up]** or **[!UICONTROL Down]** arrow.

1. To add community features (Embed, Link, Visit) to the viewer, specify options for any of the following:

   * **Email** - Click **[!UICONTROL On]** to enable an Email button in the viewer. When users click the Email button while viewing the set, an email containing the link to the set opens.

   * **Embed** - Click **[!UICONTROL Live]**. In the Embed Button Label box, type the name you want displayed in the viewer for the Embed button. If desired, click **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to locate and select a custom skin for the button.

   * **Link** - Click **[!UICONTROL Live]**. In the Link Button Label box, type the name you want displayed in the viewer for the Link button. If desired, click **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to locate and select a custom skin for the button.
