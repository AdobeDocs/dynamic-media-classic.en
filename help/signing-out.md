# Signing in to Dynamic Media Classic {#sign-in}

How you sign in to Dynamic Media Classic and sign out is based on whether you are using the desktop application or the web browser.

Regardless of how you sign in, make sure that you have the following before using Dynamic Media Classic:

* **Login name**
You use your e-mail address as your login name.

* **Password**
You obtain your temporary password in a “Welcome” e-mail from Dynamic Media Classic or from your Dynamic Media Classic administrator. The first time you sign in, you are prompted to change this temporary password.

## Signing in to Dynamic Media Classic by way of the desktop app {#sign-in-dmc-app}

1. Open Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop application.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL User Name]** field, enter your e-mail address.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Password]** field, type the password.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Server]** drop-down list, select a server. 
Use the following mapping to select the production environment you want to use.

    | Browser URL | Desktop app server name |
    |---|---|
    | https://s7sps1.scene7.com/ | NA (North America) production |
    | https://s7sps3.scene7.com/ | EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) production |
    | https://s7sps5.scene7.com/ | APAC (Asia-Pacific) production |

1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Sign In]**.

### Signing out from Dynamic Media by way of the desktop app {#sign-out-dmc-app} 

1. In the upper-right corner of the Dynamic Media Classic desktop application, tap **[!UICONTROL Sign Out]**, then tap **[!UICONTROL Sign Out]** again.

## Signing in to Dynamic Media Classic by way of your web browser {#signing-in-and-out}

In addition to your user name and password, make sure that you also have the following before using Dynamic Media Classic from your web browser:

* **Setup**
You must have been set up to use Dynamic Media Classic by your administrator.

* **URL**
You must have the URL location for accessing Dynamic Media Classic. You get this URL by way of the *Welcome* e-mail or from your Dynamic Media Classic administrator.

Because Dynamic Media Classic is web-based, going to a different web site exits the system. For example, if you click the Back button in your browser window, you exit Dynamic Media Classic.

1. Start your web browser.
1. Go to the Dynamic Media Classic sign-in URL (from the Welcome e-mail). Alternatively, you can sign in from the Dynamic Media Classic web site ( [www.adobe.com/products/scene7.html](https://www.adobe.com/products/scene7.html)) by selecting the Client Login button.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL User Name]** text field, enter your e-mail address.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Password]** text field, enter your password.
1. Optionally, you can make your computer remember your e-mail address by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Remember My User Name]** option.
1. Tap **[!UICONTROL Sign In]**.

### Signing out from Dynamic Media by way of your web browser {#sign-out}

1. Do either one of the following:

    * On the right side of the Global Navigation bar, tap **[!UICONTROL Sign Out]**.
    * Exit your browser.
