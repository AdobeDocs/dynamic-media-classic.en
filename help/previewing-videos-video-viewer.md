# Preview videos in a video viewer{#previewing-videos-in-a-video-viewer}

You can preview what a video looks like and how it plays in the Video Viewer.

See [Add and edit Viewer Presets](application-setup.md#adding_and_editing_viewer_presets).

**To preview videos in a video viewer:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, in the Show drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Video]** (single encoded videos) or **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Video Set]**. When the Adaptive Video encoding preset is used, it results in a set of multi-bitrate encoded videos.
1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate the asset folders to select the video that you want to preview.
1. Do any one of the following

    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset window, hover on an asset, and then select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, in an asset thumbnail window, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**. On the same toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.
    * In the Asset window, select an asset. In the toolbar, go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

1. (Optional) In the Preview window, in the drop-down list at the bottom, select the URL encoding that you want applied to the assetâ€™s URL when it is copied.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** link so you can review the asset in the selected viewer.
1. Close the displayed viewer.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Close]** to return to the Assets screen.

>Adobe Dynamic Media Classic provides a convenient method of previewing MP4 video on the desktop. Use this method to preview mobile content on the desktop without physically testing it on mobile devices. Be aware, however, that what is seen in desktop preview does not realistically show what playback looks like on the mobile device. To preview how video looks and plays on a mobile device, go to the Preview screen, select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]**, and enter that URL in the web browser of a mobile device. For more information, see [Deploy video to your websites and mobile sites](deploying-video-websites-mobile-sites.md#deploying_video_to_your_websites_and_mobile_sites).

## Work with video viewer presets {#working-with-video-viewer-presets}

Users watch videos in the Video Viewer. How the Video Viewer behaves, what it looks like, and how its playback controls work depends on the Viewer Preset you choose for playing the video. You choose a Viewer Preset on the Preview screen. After you choose a preset, you can obtain the URL or the embed code for playing the video using the Viewer Preset you chose.

Adobe Dynamic Media Classic comes with many predefined Viewer Presets for playing video, and if you are an administrator, you can create custom Viewer Presets. There are more than a dozen different settings for configuring the Video Viewer. You can configure its size, color, video and audio controls, progress bar, user-interface skin, and social features.

### Add or edit a video viewer preset {#adding-or-editing-a-video-viewer-preset}

In Viewer Presets you can activate, filter, sort, and preview Viewer Presets.
