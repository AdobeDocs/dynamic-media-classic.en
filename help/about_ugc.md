# About User-generated content{#about-user-generated-content}

 Using UGC (user-generated content) consists of uploading assets to a dedicated Scene7 storage repository and performing related operations.

UGC supports the following file formats:

* Raster: JPG, PNG, TIFF 
* Vector: AI, EPS, PDF (only when the PDF file is previously opened and saved in Adobe Illustrator CS6)

Before uploading assets, you obtain a shared-secret key. You use this key to retrieve an upload token. You submit the upload token when you upload assets and perform other UGC tasks.

After you retrieve a shared-secret key and upload token, you can perform the following operations for user-generated content:

* Upload an asset.
* Get image asset metadata. 
* Delete an uploaded asset. 
* Get information about a companyâ€™s disk space usage.
