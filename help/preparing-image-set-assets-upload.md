# Preparing Image Set assets for upload{#preparing-image-set-assets-for-upload}

Before uploading the images you need for Image Sets to the Scene7 Publishing System, make sure that the images are the right size and format.

To create a multiple-view Image Set, you need images that show an item from different points of view or show different aspects of the same item. The goal is to highlight the important features of an item so viewers have a complete picture of what it looks like or does.

Because users can zoom images in Image Sets, make sure that the images are at least 2000 pixels in the largest dimension. Scene7 supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended.

For detailed instructions on uploading assets, see [Uploading files](uploading-files.md#uploading_files).
