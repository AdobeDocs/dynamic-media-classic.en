# Adjusting an image{#adjusting-an-image}

Dynamic Media Classic offers various commands for adjusting the appearance of an image. You can flip, rotate, blur, alter the color balance, and colorize an image. As you experiment with these commands, you can see their effects on the image you are working with.

See also [Creating an alias for an image](adjusting-image.md#creating_an_alias_for_an_image).

1. Click the imageâ€™s rollover Edit button and choose Adjust, or in the Browse Panel, double-click the image to open it in Detail view.
1. Select a size and Image Preset (in the bottom of the window). 
1. Use the commands on the right side of the Adjust Editor window to adjust the image:

    * Use the Flip options to flip an image horizontally or vertically. 
    * Use the Rotate slider to rotate the image. You can enter values in the Rotate field to rotate an image. Positive values rotate it clockwise; negative values rotate it counterclockwise.
    * Use the Blur slider or its corresponding box to blur an image. The higher the value, the more blurry the image becomes.
    * Use the Contrast, Brightness, Saturation, Hue, and Color Balance options to adjust the color and brightness. These effects are cumulative. For example, changes to the Magenta/Green settings are added to changes made to the Hue settings.
    * Use the Colorize options to colorize an image while preserving shadows and highlights. Changes to the Colorize options are also cumulative. Choose the Brightness menu and choose No Compensation to disable automatic brightness compensation. Set the contrast value to 0 to preserve the contrast range of the original image, or specify a contrast range with a value greater than 0. A value of 100 maximizes the contrast. Typical values are in the 30-70 range.

    * Click **Save**.
    * To replace the original of the image, click **Save As**.

      In the drop-down list, select **Replace original**, and then click **Save**.

      In the drop-down list, select **Save as new master**.

      In the **Folder Name** list box, select the folder where you want the new master image saved.

      Click **Save**.
    
    * To save the image as additional view of the master image. you can create an alias for it. Click **Save As**.

      In the **Save As** dialog box, in the drop-down list, click **Save as additional view of master**.
