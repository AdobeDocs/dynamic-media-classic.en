# Publishing templates{#publishing-templates}

Publishing your template places it on Dynamic Media Image Servers, where it is available to your web site and application. During the publishing process, Dynamic Media Classic activates the URLs you need for your web site and application.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To use your template, publish all content that went into making it, including fonts and images. If you do not include all the required files, an error message appears when you publish.

## Marking templates for publish {#marking-templates-for-publish}

Templates and all their support files must be marked for publish in order for them to be placed on Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can mark these items for publish in the Browse Panel by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Mark for Publish]** icon.

## Publishing your template {#publishing-your-template}

To publish templates to Dynamic Media Image Servers, on the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**, then select a **[!UICONTROL When]** option. You can optionally enter a name for the publish job. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.
