You can automate set generation as an independent job that is not dependent of an upload.

**To automate Image Set generation:**

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Generate Set]**.
1. In the Generate Set dialog box, specify a job name.

   By default, the job is given a name that indicates it is a generated job and when the job was generated.

1. Select the preset that you want to apply.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destination Folder]**,  and then specify the folder that you want to use.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.
