You can automate set generation as an independent job that is not dependent of an upload.

**To automate Image Set generation**

1. Click **File** &gt; **Generate Set**.
1. In the Generate Set dialog box, specify a job name.

   By default, the job is given a name that indicates it is a generated job and when the job was generated.

1. Select the preset that you want to apply.
1. Click **Destination Folder** and specify the folder that you want to use.
1. Click **Submit**.
