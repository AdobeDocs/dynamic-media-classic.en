# Best practices and enforced limits by Dynamic Media on asset types

When you create a Spin Set or an Image Set, or upload PDFs for page extraction, Adobe enforces the following limits:

| Asset type | Limit type | Enforced limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Image Set | Number of duplicate assets per set | 20 |
|  | Maximum number of images per set | 1000 |
|Spin Set | Maximum number of rows/columns per 2D set | 1000 |
| PDF | Maximum page size of a PDF to be considered for extraction | 1000 (for refresh uploads) |
