# Quick Start: Target Classic integration{#quick-start-target-classic-integration}

 Adobe Target Classic puts control directly in the hands of marketers to quickly and continually run multiple A/B and multivariate tests, measure effectiveness, and increase relevance of online content through segmentation, targeting, and automated personalization.

Scene7 Publishing Systems lets you create offers and offer sets for Target Classic campaigns. For example, you can create an offer set with three variations of the same rich media asset. Then you can have Target Classic determine which asset provides better conversion lift. You can create offers and offer sets from a Basic Template or from individual images. After the offer set is pushed or saved to Adobe Target Classic, where the offers are associated with mboxes and experiences, Target Classic can run campaigns to determine which variation of a website is likely to perform best for click-throughs and conversion.

For greater customization of dynamic Scene7 content, use Target Classic HTML offers. See the Target Classic product documentation for more information.

**Quick Start**

This Quick Start is designed to get you up and running quickly with Target Classic HTML offer sets. Follow steps 1 through 3. After each step is a cross-reference to a topic heading where you can find more information.

**1. Enter your Target Classic URL in the Application General Settings screen.**

Scene7 needs your Target Classic URL to integrate with Target Classic. Copy the portion of your Target Classic URL up to and including *.com*, and enter it in the Scene7 Application General Settings screen. See [Integrating Scene7 with Target Classic](integrating-scene7-target-classic.md#integrating_scene7_with_target_classic).

**2. Create the offer set**

Use a parameterized template or images to create an offer set. You create HTML offer sets on the Target Classic Offer Set screen. To open this screen, select your template or images, and click **Build** &gt; **Target Classic Offer Set**.

To create an offer with a template, click **Add & Preview**. On the Add & Preview screen, change parameter values.

To create an offer with images, drag images into the Target Classic Offer Set screen. Click **Preview** to choose an Image Preset for an image or all the images in the offer set.

Save the offer set after you create it.

See [Creating an offer set](creating-offer-set.md#creating_an_offer_set).

**3. Push the offer set to Target Classic**

In the Target Classic Offer Set screen, click **Push Offers**, and enter your login credentials in the Target Classic Login dialog box. See [Pushing offer sets to Target Classic](pushing-offer-sets-target-classic.md#pushing_offer_sets_to_target_classic).
