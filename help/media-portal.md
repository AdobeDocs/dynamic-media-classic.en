# Media Portal{#media-portal}

Adobe Media Portal provides companies with the ability to easily acquire, control, and distribute approved creative assets to external partners and channels, as well as internal business users. This browser-based, “self-serve” environment provides portal users with administrator-controlled “views” into Scene7 assets for easy access to upload, browse, search, preview, and export assets in corporate-approved formats.
