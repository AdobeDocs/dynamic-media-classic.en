Adobe Media Portal provides companies with the ability to easily acquire, control, and distribute approved assets to external partners and channels, as well as internal users. The browser-based, “self-serve” environment provides portal users with administrator-controlled “views” into Dynamic Media Classic assets for easy access to upload, browse, search, preview, and export assets in corporate-approved formats.
