# XML files{#xml-files}

Web sites that use an XML-based system to manage images and image information can upload XML files to the Scene7 Publishing System. You can designate one of these files as the preprocessing rule set file for Image Serving. This file restructures the standard Image Serving protocol format to meet the business logic of your commerce server. On the Setup screen, you can specify an XML file to serve as the rule set definitions file path. This path setting is located under Catalog Management on the Image Server Publishing screen. See [Image Server](publish-setup.md#image_server).
