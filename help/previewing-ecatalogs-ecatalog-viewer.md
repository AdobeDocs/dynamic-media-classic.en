# Previewing eCatalogs in the eCatalog Viewer{#previewing-ecatalogs-in-the-ecatalog-viewer}

You can use Preview to display your eCatalog using different eCatalog Viewer Presets. You can experiment with the different controls to turn pages, write sticky notes, and browse.

See [Configuring Default Viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

See [Previewing an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing_an_asset).

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, in the Show drop-down list, select a video-based asset type such as Video or Video Set.
