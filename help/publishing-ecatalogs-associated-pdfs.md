# Publishing eCatalogs and associated PDFs{#publishing-ecatalogs-and-associated-pdfs}

Publishing places your eCatalog and PDF on Dynamic Media Image Servers so it can be made available to your web site or application. As part of the publishing process, Dynamic Media Classic activates the URL string. You can place this URL string in your HTML web page code.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure your eCatalog and PDF reside in the same folder and they are marked for publish in the Browse Panel or Asset Details page before you publish them.

To publish your eCatalog to Dynamic Media Image Servers:

1. Click **Publish** on the Global Navigation bar.
1. On the Publish screen, select a When option (One-Time or Recurring).
1. (Optional) Enter a name for the publish job, but keep the time-and-date stamp.

   If you set up your eCatalog so that viewers can perform keyword searches, make sure that the keyword data is published. Click Advanced, then click Advanced options. On the Publish drop-down menu, click Full W/ Search Data. This option is selected by default.

1. Click **Start Publish**.
