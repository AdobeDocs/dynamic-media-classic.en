# Linking URLs to your web application{#linking-urls-to-your-web-application}

Your web sites and applications access Scene7 Image Server content via URL strings. After you publish an image, Dynamic Media Classic activates a URL string that references the Image Preset on Dynamic Media Classic Image Servers. You can paste these URLs into a web browser for testing.

To place these URL strings in your web pages and applications, copy them from the Scene7 Publishing System. To obtain a URL string generated with an Image Preset, go to the Preview screen or the Browse Panel (in Detail view).

## Obtaining an Image Preset URL {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url}

You can obtain a URL string generated by an Image Preset from Preview or from Detail View. After you copy the URL, it lands on the Clipboard so you can paste it as necessary.

***Note**: The URL is not active until you publish the asset.*

### Obtaining an Image Preset URL from Preview {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url-from-preview}

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folders that contains the image asset you want to preview.
1. Do any one of the following:

    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, click Grid View. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then below the thumbnail image, click Preview &gt; Image Preset List.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, click List View. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, click Preview &gt; Image Preset List.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, click Detail View. On the same toolbar, click Preview &gt; Image Preset List.

1. (Optional) In the Image Preset List window, in the URL Encoding for Copy URL Generation drop-down list at the bottom, select the URL encoding that you want applied to the image asset’s URL when it is copied.
1. In the Image Preset List window, in the upper-right area of the preview pane, click Copy URL for the selected preset type.
1. In the lower-right corner of the Image Preset List window, click Close to return to the Assets screen.

### Obtaining an Image Preset URL from the Browse Panel {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url-from-the-browse-panel}

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folders that contains the image asset you want to preview.
1. Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, click Grid View. In the Asset window, select a single image asset.
1. Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, click Detail View.
1. Click URLs on the panel on the right side of the screen to unfold the list of Image Presets.
1. Click Copy URL link next to the name of the Image Preset with the URL you want to copy to the Clipboard.

## About Image Preset URL strings {#about-image-preset-url-strings}

A URL call for Image Sizing to Dynamic Media Classic Image Servers has the following basic syntax:

*path*/*name of Image Server*/*account name*/*image name*?*modifier1*&*modifier2*&...

In a Dynamic Media Classic Image Server URL, instructions to the server for displaying the image appear after the question mark (?). For example, this URL call delivers an image named “backpack” at a width of 250 pixels:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?wid=250
```

An Image Preset URL contains all the modifier instructions for presenting the image at the proper size and formatting specifications. Without an Image Preset, notice all the modifier instructions after the question mark (?) in this URL string:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?wid=250&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80,0&resMode=sharp&op_usm=1.1,0.5,1,0
```

However, in a URL string generated with an Image Preset, the name of the Image Preset appears in place of the instructions defined by the Image Preset. For example, referring to the long URL above, the URL string is:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?$Large$
```

Image Preset names in URLs are enclosed in dollar signs ($). When a Dynamic Media Classic Image Server encounters the Image Preset portion of the URL (the `Large` in this case), using the size and formatting instructions defined by the “Large” Image Preset.

## Adding dynamic images to your web page {#adding-dynamic-images-to-your-web-page}

To add dynamic images to your web page, the `<IMG>` tag in your HTML web page code typically is modified using the Dynamic Media Classic URL string to make a request to Dynamic Media Classic Image Servers. This string produces the image at the size and formatting specifications defined by the Image Preset.

For example, instead of the typical call to open a static image such as

```as3
img src="/company_images/products/backpack_thumbnail.jpg"
```

you now use the `<IMG>`tag to replace the reference to a static image with an Image Preset call to the Dynamic Media Classic platform. A sample call looks like this:

```as3
img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack_trns?$thumbnail$”
```

In this example, a Dynamic Media Classic Image Server “looks up” the definition of `$thumbnail$` and dynamically generates the appropriate image with the sizing and formatting specifications defined by the `thumbnail`Image Preset. In a URL string, all items except the product image filename ( `backpack_trns` in this case) are typically hardwired for the page template. The only element that is automatically inserted in the page template from your commerce server is the IPS ID or name of the image.
