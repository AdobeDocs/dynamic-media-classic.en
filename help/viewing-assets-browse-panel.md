# Viewing assets in the Browse panel{#viewing-assets-in-the-browse-panel}

You can change your view of assets in the Browse Panel by selecting a View button:

* **Grid view** - Near the upper-right corner of the Dynamic Media Classic screen, click **[!UICONTROL Grid View]** icon to see assets in thumbnail form in a grid. In Grid view, you can drag the Thumbnail slider to change the size of the thumbnail images.

* **List view** - Near the upper-right corner of the Dynamic Media Classic screen, click **[!UICONTROL List View]** icon to see assets in a list. The list tells you the name, type, creation date, and last-modification date of each asset. Depending on the type of asset you are working with, you get other information as well. For example, you can see the dimensions and file size of an image.

* **Detail view** - Select an asset. Near the upper-right corner of the Dynamic Media Classic screen, click **[!UICONTROL Detail View]** icon to examine the asset in Detail view. You can also double-click an asset or select it and click **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Details]** to see it in Detail view. If your administrator has specified the Show URL preference, URLs appear for all assets in Detail view; however, the URLs are only active after the asset is published.
