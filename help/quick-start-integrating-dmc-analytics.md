# Quick Start: Integrating Dynamic Media Classic and Adobe Analytics {#quick-start-integrating-dmc-analytics}

Adobe Analytics is the industry-leading product that provides marketers with one place where they can measure, analyze, and optimize integrated data from all online initiatives across multiple marketing channels.

After integrating Adobe Analytics with Dynamic Media Classic, you can get reports about the behavior of website visitors using Dynamic Media Classic viewers on your website. For example, when a website visitor clicks a zoom target in a Dynamic Media Classic Zoom Viewer, Adobe Analytics records this action. Adobe Analytics reports can gather cumulative information about user activity in Dynamic Media Classic viewers.

Using Adobe Analytics reports, you can get a clear picture of the activity of customers on your website. You can determine which product presentations lead to conversion and which do not attract customer interest.

>A valid Adobe Analytics account is required to integrate Analytics with Dynamic Media Classic and generate Analytics reports.

This Quick Start is designed to get you up and running quickly with Adobe Analytics Instrumentation Kit.

## 1. Log in to Adobe Analytics by way of Dynamic Media Classic and download Adobe Analytics report variables

>[!NOTE]
>
>Before you can configure Adobe Analytics reports and match Adobe Analytics report variables to Dynamic Media Classic events, verify that you are added as a member of the Web Service Access group in Adobe Analytics. Members in this group can access all reports in the specified report suites by way of the Marketing Cloudâ€™s Web Services API regardless of the permissions set in the interface. To add a member to the group, in Adobe Analytics, click **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit Groups]**.

After you have verified that you are a member of the Web Service Access group, in Dynamic Media Classic, click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Application Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]**. On the Adobe Analytics Configuration page, click **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics Login]**.

See [Log in to Adobe Analytics](log-analytics.md#log_in_to_adobe_analytics).

In the Adobe Analytics Login dialog box, type your Marketing Cloud Org ID (optional), and your complete credentials, then click **[!UICONTROL Login]**. On the Report Suite drop-down menu, select the name of the report suite that you want to use.

## 2. Assign Adobe Analytics report variables to Dynamic Media Classic viewer events and Dynamic Media Classic variables

On the Adobe Analytics Configuration page, specify the information you want in Adobe Analytics reports. For each Dynamic Media Classic viewer event that you want information about, choose an Adobe Analytics variable (from your report suite) and a Dynamic Media Classic variable.

* Viewer events describe the user activity that you want to measure in reports.
* Dynamic Media Classic variables describe the data about user events that you want the reports to deliver.

The Adobe Analytics Configuration also offers tools for activating, editing, and deleting viewer events.

After you click **[!UICONTROL Save]** in the Adobe Analytics Configuration page, customized tracking code for measuring user activity is inserted in Dynamic Media Classic viewers. This functionality lets you track user activity in Adobe Analytics reports.

See [Configuring Adobe Analytics reports](configuring-analytics-reports.md#configuring_adobe_analytics_reports).

## 3. Publish your Dynamic Media Classic viewers

Publish your Dynamic Media Classic viewers so that the viewers (with code for tracking user activity in Adobe Analytics reports) are loaded on Dynamic Media Classic servers. After you publish, this information is included in viewers and can be used for analyses by Adobe Analytics.

See [Publishing configuration information](publishing-analytics-configuration-information.md#publishing_adobe_analytics_configuration_information).

## 4. Place Dynamic Media Classic viewers in your website

Place the Dynamic Media Classic viewers with Adobe Analytics tracking code on your website.

## 5. Test the Adobe Analytics integration by viewing an Adobe Analytics report

To view Adobe Analytics reports, go to the Adobe Analytics website. The Reporting page lets you view data and generate graphs and charts to measure user activity with different viewers.

See [Testing the Adobe Analytics integration by viewing an Adobe Analytics report](testing-integration-viewing-analytics-report.md#testing_the_integration_by_viewing_an_adobe_analytics_report).
