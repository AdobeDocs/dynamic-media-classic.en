## Browse Panel/Build Panel {#browse-panel-build-panel}

The Browse/Build Panel is where you do much of your work. The functions that are available in this panel depend on whether you are in Browse mode or Build mode.

This panel offers the **[!UICONTROL File]**, **[!UICONTROL Preview]**, **[!UICONTROL Select All]**, **[!UICONTROL Select None]**, and **[!UICONTROL Sort]** menus for working with assets. You can also view assets in different ways by moving the slider or click **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**, **[!UICONTROL List View]**, or **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**.
