## Asset Library {#asset-library}

At the top of the Asset Library panel are commands for locating assets. You can search for assets and filter to locate assets. Click the Trash icon  ![](assets/Trash_icon.png)

## Browse Panel/Build Panel {#browse-panel-build-panel}

The Browse/Build Panel is where you do much of your work. What appears in this panel depends on whether you are working in Browse mode or Build mode:

**Browse mode** Select a folder in the Asset Library to view and work with its contents in the Browse Panel. This panel offers the File, Preview, Select All, Select None, and Sort menus for working with assets. You can also view assets in different ways by moving the slider or selecting the Grid View , List View , or Detail View button. Selecting the Detail View button or double-clicking an asset opens the asset in Detail view, where you can perform asset-dependent file operations.

**Build mode** Click Build, then choose an option to start building an eCatalog, Image Set, Spin Set, or one of several other available items on the Build menu. The Build screen opens. You can select the assets you want to work with before or after you enter Build mode.
