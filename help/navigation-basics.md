**Upload** Opens the Upload screen so you can upload files from your computer or network to SPS. You can upload files from your desktop or via FTP. See Uploading files.

**Build** Choose a Build task from the menu. The Build panel opens so you can create an asset type.

**Publish** Opens the Publish screen so you can publish rich media assets to Scene7 Image Servers and the rest of the Scene7 SAAS Infrastructure. See Publishing.

**Jobs** Opens the Jobs screen so you can examine records of upload and publish jobs.

**Recent** Opens the Recent Activity screen so you can view the names of recently modified assets and recent upload and publish jobs.

**Setup** Opens the Setup screen so you can choose setup or administration options for optimizing your use of Scene7. See Setup.

## Asset Library {#asset-library}

## Browse Panel/Build Panel {#browse-panel-build-panel}

The Browse/Build Panel is where you do much of your work. What appears in this panel depends on whether you are working in Browse mode or Build mode:

**Browse mode** Select a folder in the Asset Library to view and work with its contents in the Browse Panel. This panel offers the File, Preview, Select All, Select None, and Sort menus for working with assets. You can also view assets in different ways by moving the slider or selecting the Grid View , List View , or Detail View button. Selecting the Detail View button or double-clicking an asset opens the asset in Detail view, where you can perform asset-dependent file operations.

**Build mode** Click **Build**, then choose an option to start building an eCatalog, Image Set, Spin Set, or one of several other available items on the Build menu. The Build screen opens. You can select the assets you want to work with before or after you enter Build mode.
