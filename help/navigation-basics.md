# Navigation basics{#navigation-basics}

The Dynamic Media Classic screen includes three major areas: Global Navigation bar, Asset Library, and Browse Panel/Build Panel.

## Asset Library {#asset-library}

Use the Asset Library to organize the assets you are working with. You can create folders and subfolders for organizing your assets in the Asset Library.

At the top of the Asset Library panel are commands for locating assets. You can search for assets and filter to locate assets. Click the Trash icon at the bottom of the Asset Library to examine assets you deleted.

>You can click Asset Library controls to open or close the Asset Library and get more room to work onscreen. Select the Expand/Collapse control to expand or close the panel. These controls are located on the left side of the panel.

## Browse Panel/Build Panel {#browse-panel-build-panel}

The Browse/Build Panel is where you do much of your work. What appears in this panel depends on whether you are working in Browse mode or Build mode:

**Browse mode** Select a folder in the Asset Library to view and work with its contents in the Browse Panel. This panel offers the File, Preview, Select All, Select None, and Sort menus for working with assets. You can also view assets in different ways by moving the slider or selecting the Grid View , List View , or Detail View button. Selecting the Detail View button or double-clicking an asset opens the asset in Detail view, where you can perform asset-dependent file operations.

**Build mode** Click Build, then choose an option to start building an eCatalog, Image Set, Spin Set, or one of several other available items on the Build menu. The Build screen opens. You can select the assets you want to work with before or after you enter Build mode.
