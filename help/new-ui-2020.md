## _Last updated June 30, 2020_

Dynamic Media classic users now have access to a new sign in experience that no longer relies on Adobe Flash technology in the browser. Read the following Frequently Asked Questions to learn more.

### **_When browsers stop supporting Adobe Flash on December 31, 2020, will there be any impact to Dynamic Media Classic (formerly Scene7)?_**

Adobe Flash Player is a web browser plug-in that lets web browsers use content developed on the Adobe Flash Platform. The web user interface of Dynamic Media Classic&ndash;currently labeled [!DNL Scene7 Publishing System] or [!DNL SPS] in the product&ndash;currently requires the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe has provided customers with a desktop application that now replaces the browser application.

### **_When will the new desktop app be available to Dynamic Media Classic customers?_**

The new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app is now available for download and installation. We recommend that you install the app by October 1, 2020, to ensure a smooth transition before Adobe Flash Player is deprecated on December 31, 2020.  On that date, it will no longer be possible to sign in to the browser version of Dynamic Media Classic (labeled as [!DNL Scene7 Publishing System] in the product).

See [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app](/help/dynamic-media-classic-desktop-app.md) to review system requirements, download and install the app, and then sign in to it.

### **_How will I access the new desktop app?_**

The new desktop app is a `.dmg` installer for macOS and `.exe` installer for Windows.

See [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app](/help/dynamic-media-classic-desktop-app.md) to review system requirements, download and install the app, and then sign in to it.

The download links will also be shared by way of the Dynamic Media Classic newsletter.

### **_How will the new desktop app work?_**

After you download, install, and launch the desktop app, you are presented with a refreshed sign in experience. By entering your existing user name and password and selecting the appropriate server based on your region, you will be signed in Dynamic Media Classic. You will notice that the overall experience is the same as the familiar browser version you are used to. From the desktop app, you can access the Dynamic Media Classic Production and Staging environments. You can also access Media Portal if you are credentialed for this capability.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Only one instance of the desktop app can be installed and be active at a time.

### **_Will this new desktop app experience require any migrations or changes to third-party integrations?_**

No. Dynamic Media Classic customers do not have to migrate or change any third-party integrations to use the new desktop app.

### **_Will this change affect my automation scripts?_**

No. There is no impact to automation scripts. The new desktop app acts and behaves in a way that is similar to the browser-based experience that you are already familiar with.

### **_Will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app work on Macs and personal computers?_**

Yes. The new desktop app is a cross-platform solution and works on Macs and PCs. Linux is *not* supported.

### **_My company has strict security requirements. How will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app handle these requirements?_**

Adobe is committed to ensuring our products meet the security requirements of its customers. The new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app will continue to provide customers a highly secure experience that conforms to all Adobe security standards. 

### **_My company does not let us install software and apps onto our computers. How do you recommend we get access to the new desktop app?_**

If your company does not let you download and install software and apps onto your system without approval, work with your IT teams early to gain permission to access the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app. Remember that after December 31, 2020 the browser version will be deprecated. It is important that you avoid waiting until the last minute to download the new desktop app.

### **_Will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app require a new SKU? Is there a license cost involved?_**

No SKU or license change is required to use the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app.

### **_How will upgrades to Dynamic Media Classic desktop app be enabled?_**
