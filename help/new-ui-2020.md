# New Dynamic Media Classic login experience available June 30, 2020 {#new-ui-2020}

## _Last updated May 7, 2020_

On June 30, 2020, Dynamic Media classic users will gain access to a new login experience that no longer relies on Adobe Flash technology in the browser. Read the following Frequently Asked Questions to learn more.

### **_When browsers stop supporting Adobe Flash on December 31, 2020, will there be any impact to Dynamic Media Classic (formerly Scene7)?_**

Adobe Flash Player is a web browser plug-in that lets web browsers use content developed on the Adobe Flash Platform. The web user interface of Dynamic Media Classic&ndash;currently labeled Scene7 Publishing System or SPS in the product&ndash;currently requires the Adobe Flash Player. Adobe will provide customers with a desktop application that replaces the browser application.

### **_When will the new desktop app be available to Dynamic Media Classic customers?_**

The new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app will be available for download starting on June 30, 2020. We recommend that you install the app by October 1, 2020, to ensure a smooth transition before Adobe Flash Player is deprecated on December 31, 2020.  On that date, it will no longer be possible to log on to the browser version of Dynamic Media Classic (labeled as Scene7 Publishing System in the product).

### **_How will I access the new desktop app?_**

The new desktop app will be a `.dmg` installer for macOS and `.exe` installer for Windows. Links to download these installers will be updated in the Dynamic Media Classic public documentation on June 30, 2020. The links will also be shared by way of the Dynamic Media Classic newsletter. Subscribe here to stay up to date.

### **_How will the new desktop app work?_**

After you download, install, and launch the desktop app, you are presented with a refreshed logon experience. By entering your existing user name and password and selecting the appropriate server based on your region, you will be logged into Dynamic Media Classic. You will notice that the overall experience is the same as the familiar browser version you are used to. From the desktop app, you can access the Dynamic Media Classic Production and Staging environments. You can also access Media Portal if you are credentialed for this capability.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Only one instance of the desktop app can be installed and be active at a time.

### **_What if I am using the Dynamic Media Classic APIs to access the product and do not log on through the web user interface?_**

There are no changes to the underlying APIs for Dynamic Media Classic.

### **_Will this new desktop app experience require any migrations or changes to third-party integrations?_**

No. Dynamic Media Classic customers do not have to migrate or change any third-party integrations to use the new desktop app.

### **_Will this change affect my automation scripts?_**

No. There is no impact to automation scripts. The new desktop app acts and behaves in a way that is similar to the browser-based experience that you are already familiar with.

### **_Will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app work on Macs and personal computers?_**

Yes. The new desktop app will be a cross-platform solution and works on Macs and PCs. Linux will not be supported.

### **_My company has strict security requirements. How will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app handle these requirements?_**

Adobe is committed to ensuring our products meet the security requirements of its customers. The new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app will continue to provide customers a highly secure experience that conforms to all Adobe security standards. 

### **_My company does not let us install software and apps onto our computers. How do you recommend we get access to the new desktop app?_**

If your company does not let you download and install software and apps onto your system without approval, work with your IT teams early to gain permission to access the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app. Remember that after December 31, 2020 the browser version will be deprecated. It is important that you avoid waiting until the last minute to download the new desktop app.

### **_Will the new Dynamic Media Classic desktop app require a new SKU? Is there a license cost involved?_**
