# Adobe Dynamic Media Classic Desktop app - Now available {#new-ui-2020}

See [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app](/help/dynamic-media-classic-desktop-app.md) to review system requirements, download and install the new app, and then sign in to it.

## _Last updated June 30, 2020_

Adobe Dynamic Media Classic users now have access to a new sign-in experience that no longer relies on Adobe Flash technology in the browser.

### **_When browsers stop supporting Adobe Flash on December 31, 2020, will there be any impact to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic (formerly Scene7)?_**

Adobe Flash Player was a web browser plug-in that allowed web browsers to use content developed on the Adobe Flash Platform. The web user interface of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic (currently labeled [!DNL Scene7 Publishing System] or [!DNL SPS] in the product) required the Adobe Flash Player. When Adobe Flash is deprecated December 31, 2020, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic customers will no longer be able to log into the web user interface. Because of this change, Adobe has provided customers with a desktop app that replaces the browser experience.

### **_How do I access the new desktop app?_**

The new desktop app is available as a `.dmg` installer for macOS or as an `.exe` installer for Windows®.

See [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app](/help/dynamic-media-classic-desktop-app.md) to review system requirements, download, and install the new app, and then sign in to it.

<!-- NEWSLETTER IS DEAD The download links are also available by way of the [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic newsletter subscription page.](https://www.adobe.com/subscription/dynamic-media-newsletter.html) -->

### **_How does the new desktop app work?_**

After you download, install, and launch the desktop app, you are presented with a refreshed sign-in experience. By entering your existing user name and password and selecting the appropriate server based on your region, you can sign in to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic. The overall experience is the same as the familiar web browser version you are used to. From the desktop app, you can access the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic Production and Staging environments. You can also access Media Portal if you are credentialed for this capability.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Only one instance of the desktop app can be installed *and* active at a time on a given computer. However, there is no restriction on the number of installations you can have across computers.

### **_What if I am using the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic APIs to access the product and do not sign in through the web user interface?_**

There are no changes to the underlying APIs for Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

### **_Does this new desktop app experience require any migrations or changes to third-party integrations?_**

No. Adobe Dynamic Media Classic customers do not have to migrate or change any third-party integrations to use the new desktop app.

### **_Does this change affect my automation scripts?_**

No. There is no impact to automation scripts. The new desktop app acts and behaves in a way that is similar to the browser-based experience that you are already familiar with.

### **_Will the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app work on Macs and personal computers?_**

Yes. The new desktop app is a cross-platform solution and works on Macs and PCs. Linux® is *not* supported.

### **_My company has strict security requirements. How does the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app handle these requirements?_**

Adobe is committed to ensuring its products meet the security requirements of its customers. The new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app continues to provide customers with a highly secure experience that conforms to all Adobe security standards. 

### **_My company does not let me install software and apps onto my computer. How do you recommend I get access to the new desktop app?_**

Some companies do not let you download and install software and apps onto your system without approval. In such cases, work with your IT teams early to gain permission to access the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app. Remember that after December 31, 2020 the browser version will be deprecated. It is important that you avoid waiting until the last minute to download the new desktop app.

### **_Can multiple instances of the new desktop app be open at the same time?_**

No, the AIR technology on which the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app is built restricts a user from having multiple instances of the app open at a given time.

### **_Are there any restrictions on the number of files that can be uploaded to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic by way of a local computer?_**

When using the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app on Windows®, you can upload a maximum of 150 files at a time using the **[!UICONTROL Upload]** dialog box. This limitation was already addressed before the end of 2020. There are *no* upload restrictions on the macOS Platform.

### **_Does the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app require a new SKU? Is there a license cost involved?_**

No SKU or license change is required to use the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app.

### **_How are upgrades to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app enabled?_**

Following the release of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app on June 30, 2020, if Adobe releases a new version, customers are required to download the new version and install as usual (replace the existing app in **[!UICONTROL Applications]**). You are notified of the new release through your CSM (Customer Success Manager) and an in-app upgrade notification mechanism that notifies users of an upgrade.
