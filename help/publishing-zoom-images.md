# Publishing zoom images{#publishing-zoom-images}

Publishing places your zoom images on Dynamic Media Image Servers so they can be made available to your web site and application. As part of the publishing process, Dynamic Media Classic activates the URL strings. You can place these URL strings in the HTML code of your web site.

## Marking images for publish {#marking-images-for-publish}

Images must be marked for publish in order for them to be copied to Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can mark your images for publish in the Browse Panel by selecting the **Mark for Publish** icon. As well, you can mark images for publish when you upload them.

## Publishing the images {#publishing-the-images}

To publish zoom images, start by clicking **Publish** on the Global Navigation bar. Then, select a **When option (One-Time or Recurring)**, optionally enter a name for the publish job, and click **Start Publish**.
