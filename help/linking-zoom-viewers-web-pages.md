# Linking Zoom viewers to your web pages{#linking-zoom-viewers-to-your-web-pages}

Your web sites and applications access Scene7 Image Server content, including master images and associated zoom targets, and Zoom Viewer Presets, by way of URL strings or embedded code. These URL strings are activated during the publishing process. To place these URL strings or the embedded code in your web pages and applications, you copy them from the Scene7 Publishing System.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copying a Zoom viewer URL {#copying-a-zoom-viewer-url}

1. in the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the asset folder that contains the Zoom viewer whose URL you want to copy.
1. Above the Asset Browse panel, on the right side of the toolbar, do one of the following:

    * Click **Grid View** or **List View**. In the Asset Browse panel, double-click a single asset to open it in Detail View. In the URLs and Embed Code panel on the right, click **Copy URL** to the right of the viewer you want.
    * Click **Grid View**. In the Asset Browse panel, select a single asset, and then below the thumbnail image, click **Preview** &gt; **Viewer List**.

      In the Viewer List page, under the Actions column of the table, click **Copy URL**.
    
    * Click **List View**. In the Asset Browse panel, select a single asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, click **Preview** &gt; **Viewer List**.

    * Click **Grid View**, **List View**, or **Detail View**. On the same toolbar, click **Preview** &gt; **Viewer List**.

      In the Viewer List page, under the Actions column of the table, click **Copy URL**.

## Adding Zoom viewer URLs to your web page {#adding-zoom-viewer-urls-to-your-web-page}

Typically, visitors to a web site zoom images by first selecting a Zoom icon (often the icon shows the image of a magnifying glass). Selecting this icon launches a dynamic web page (ASP or JSP) that displays the image in a pop-up window. The pop-up window is where visitors actually zoom the image.

For additional details and code samples, see [Embedding HTML5 Basic Zoom Viewer in the Viewers Reference Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/s7/viewers_ref/c_html5_20_basic_zoom_viewer_about.html).

## Copying the embed copy of a Zoom viewer {#copying-the-embed-copy-of-a-zoom-viewer}

Using the Embed Code feature lets you review the viewer code for the selected Zoom viewer. You can also copy the code to the clipboard so you can paste it in your web pages for deployment of the viewer. Editing of the code is not permitted in the Embed Code dialog box.
