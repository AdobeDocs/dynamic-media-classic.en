# Linking Zoom viewers to your web pages{#linking-zoom-viewers-to-your-web-pages}

Your web sites and applications access Dynamic Media Image Server content, including master images and associated zoom targets, and Zoom Viewer Presets, by way of URL strings or embedded code. These URL strings are activated during the publishing process. To place these URL strings or the embedded code in your web pages and applications, you copy them from Dynamic Media Classic.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Adding Zoom viewer URLs to your web page {#adding-zoom-viewer-urls-to-your-web-page}

Typically, visitors to a web site zoom images by first selecting a Zoom icon (often the icon shows the image of a magnifying glass). Selecting this icon launches a dynamic web page (ASP or JSP) that displays the image in a pop-up window. The pop-up window is where visitors actually zoom the image.

## Copying the embed copy of a Zoom viewer {#copying-the-embed-copy-of-a-zoom-viewer}

Using the Embed Code feature lets you review the viewer code for the selected Zoom viewer. You can also copy the code to the clipboard so you can paste it in your web pages for deployment of the viewer. Editing of the code is not permitted in the Embed Code dialog box.
