# Publishing Adobe Analytics configuration information{#publishing-adobe-analytics-configuration-information}

Publish your Scene7 viewers so that information about configuring Adobe Analytics reports is sent to Scene7 servers. This information is embedded in viewers. Publishing is necessary so that the information contained in the viewers is available on Scene7 servers. From the servers, it can be relayed to Adobe Analytics after users perform activity on the viewers.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Whenever you change Adobe Analytics Report settings within Adobe Analytics, be sure you log back on to Adobe Analytics from within Adobe Scene7 Publishing System, re-save your Adobe Analytics configuration settings, and then re-publish.

See [Log in to Adobe Analytics](log-analytics.md#log_in_to_adobe_analytics).

See [Configuring Adobe Analytics reports](configuring-analytics-reports.md#configuring_adobe_analytics_reports).

**To publish configuration information**

1. On the Global Navigation bar, click **Publish**.
1. In the Publish dialog box, click **Start Publish**.
