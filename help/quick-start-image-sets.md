# Quick Start: Image Sets{#quick-start-image-sets}

Dynamic Media Classic Image Sets give users an integrated viewing experience. In the dynamic Image Set Viewer, users can see different views of an item by clicking a thumbnail image. Image Sets lets you present alternative high-resolution views of an item.

The Image Set Viewer offers zooming tools for examining images closely. If you want, you can make guided zoom targets and Image Maps part of your Image Set. Image Sets make for a more concerted, intimate viewing experience.

This Image Sets Quick Start is designed to get up and running quickly with Image Set techniques in Dynamic Media Classic.

## 1. Uploading your master images for multiple views and swatches

Start by uploading the images for your Image Sets. Because users can zoom on images in the Image Set Viewer, be sure you account for this ability when choosing images. Make sure that the images are least 2000 pixels in the largest size. Dynamic Media Classic supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended.

On the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to upload files from your computer to a folder on Dynamic Media Classic.

See [Preparing Image Set assets for upload](preparing-image-set-assets-upload.md#preparing-image-set-assets-for-upload) and [Uploading your files](uploading-files.md#uploading-your-files).

## 2. Creating an Image Set

In Image Sets, users click thumbnail images in the Image Set Viewer to see an image from a different side or angle.

To create an Image Set, on the Global Navigation bar, click **[!UICONTROL Build]**, then choose **[!UICONTROL Image Sets]**. On the Image Set window, drag your images onto the page to compose your Image Set. Organize, add, and delete images as needed.

See [Creating an Image Set](creating-image-set.md#creating-an-image-set).

See also [Including zoom targets and Image Maps in Image Sets](including-zoom-targets-image-maps.md#including-zoom-targets-and-image-maps-in-image-sets)

## 3. Setting up Image Set Viewer Presets, as needed

Administrators can create or modify Image Set Viewer Presets. Dynamic Media Classic comes with default Viewer Presets for each rich media type. Use the Zoom Viewer: Custom > Images or Image Sets/Multiple Views presets to view your Image Sets.

You add or edit Viewer Presets from the Application Setup screen.

See [Creating and editing Viewer Presets](application-setup.md#adding-and-editing-viewer-presets).

## 4. Previewing an Image Set

Select the Image Set in the Browse Panel, and then click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**. In the Preview page, click the thumbnail icons to examine your Image Set in the selected Viewer. You can choose different Viewers from the Presets menu.

See [Previewing an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing-an-asset).

## 5. Publishing an Image Set

Publishing an Image Set places it on Dynamic Media Classic servers and activates the URL string.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This step is not necessary if you selected **[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** (default) at the time you created and saved the Image Set.

Click **[!UICONTROL Mark for Publish]** icon to the left of its name in the Browse Panel. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Publish]**. On the Publish page, click **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.

See [Publishing](publishing-files.md#publishing-files).

## 6. Linking an Image Set to your Website

Dynamic Media Classic creates URL calls for Image Sets, and activates them after you publish. You can copy these URLs from the Preview screen.

Select the Image Set, and then click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**. Now select an Image Set Viewer Preset, and then click **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]**.

See [Linking an Image Set to a web page](linking-image-set-web-page.md#linking-an-image-set-to-a-web-page).
