# Quick Start: Image Sets{#quick-start-image-sets}

Scene7 Image Sets give users an integrated viewing experience. In the dynamic Image Set Viewer, users can see different views of an item by clicking a thumbnail image. Image Sets lets you present alternative high-resolution views of an item.

The Image Set Viewer offers zooming tools for examining images closely. If you want, you can make guided zoom targets and Image Maps part of your Image Set. Image Sets make for a more concerted, intimate viewing experience.

This Image Sets Quick Start is designed to get up and running quickly with Image Set techniques in Scene7.

**1. Uploading your master images for multiple views and swatches**

Start by uploading the images for your Image Sets. Because users can zoom on images in the Image Set Viewer, take zooming into account when you choose images. Make sure that the images are least 2000 pixels in the largest dimension. Scene7 supports many image file formats, but lossless TIFF, PNG, and EPS images are recommended.

Select the Upload button on the Global Navigation bar to upload files from your computer to a folder on the Scene7 Publishing System.

See [Preparing Image Set assets for upload](preparing-image-set-assets-upload.md#preparing_image_set_assets_for_upload) and [Uploading your files](uploading-files.md#uploading_your_files).

**2. Creating an Image Set**

In Image Sets, users click thumbnail images in the Image Set Viewer to see an image from a different side or angle.

To create an Image Set, click the Build button and choose Image Sets. Then, on the Image Set screen, drag your images onto the screen to compose your Image Set. Organize, add, and delete images as needed.

See [Creating an Image Set](creating-image-set.md#creating_an_image_set).

See also [Including zoom targets and Image Maps in Image Sets](including-zoom-targets-image-maps.md#including_zoom_targets_and_image_maps_in_image_sets)

**3. Setting up Image Set Viewer Presets, as needed**

Administrators can create or modify Image Set Viewer Presets. Scene7 comes with default Viewer Presets for each rich media type. Use the Zoom Viewer: Custom &gt; Images or Image Sets/Multiple Views presets to view your Image Sets.

You add or edit Viewer Presets from the Application Setup screen.

See [Creating and editing Viewer Presets](application-setup.md#adding_and_editing_viewer_presets).

**4. Previewing an Image Set**

Select the Image Set in the Browse Panel, and then click Preview. Your Image Set appears in the Preview screen. Click the thumbnail icons to examine your Image Set in the selected Viewer. You can choose different Viewers from the Presets menu.

See [Previewing an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing_an_asset).

**5. Publishing an Image Set**

Publishing an Image Set places it on Scene7 servers and activates the URL string.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This step is not necessary if you selected **Publish after save **(default) at the time you created and saved the Image Set.

Click the Mark for Publish icon to the left of its name in the Browse Panel. Then, click **Publish**. On the Publish screen, click **Start Publish**.

See [Publishing](publishing-files.md#publishing_files).

**6. Linking an Image Set to your Website**

Scene7 creates URL calls for Image Sets, and activates them after you publish. You can copy these URLs from the Preview screen.

Select the Image Set, and then click the Preview button. The Preview screen opens. Select an Image Set Viewer Preset and click **Copy URL**.

See [Linking an Image Set to a web page](linking-image-set-web-page.md#linking_an_image_set_to_a_web_page).
