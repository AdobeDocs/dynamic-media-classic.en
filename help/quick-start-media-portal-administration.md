# Quick Start: Media Portal{#quick-start-media-portal}

Media Portal lets companies easily acquire, control, and distribute approved creative assets to external partners and channels, and internal business users. This browser-based, "self-serve" environment provides Media Portal users with administrator-controlled "views" into Dynamic Media Classic assets for easy access to, browse, search, preview, and export assets in corporate-approved formats.

As an administrator, you control how users view, access, and use assets in Media Portal. Moreover, you can customize the Media Portal interface to match your web site and brand. You can specify font, font color, and font size, as well as incorporate branding elements such as logos in the Media Portal interface.

**Quick Start**

This Quick Start is designed to get you up and running quickly with Media Portal administration. At the end of each step is a cross-reference to a topic where you can get more information.

**1. Understand Media Portal user roles**

Media Portal users fall in three roles — user, contributor, and user-contributor. Each role can perform a different set of tasks. For example, a contributor can rename and delete files and folders, but a user cannot do those tasks. Understand the different roles so that when you add users, you understand what responsibilities you give them.

See [Media Portal user roles](media-portal-user-roles.md#media_portal_user_roles).

**2. Create groups for managing users**

Groups determine the folders and files to which a user has access, what users can do in those folders and files, and which Image Presets are available. As an administrator, your first task is to create groups. For each group, decide which folders, files, and Image Presets group members can access. As well, grant read, write, and delete permissions to the group members. These permissions determine whether members can browse, edit, rename, and delete the folders and files to which they have access.

See [Creating and managing Media Portal groups](creating-media-portal-groups.md#creating_and_managing_media_portal_groups).

**3. Add users**

When you add a user, you assign the user a role (user, contributor, or user-contributor). You also assign the user to one or more groups. To speed the process of adding users, you can upload a user list in the form of a CSV file. New users are sent a Welcome e-mail message and instructions for logging on to Media Portal.

See [Adding and managing Media Portal users](adding-media-portal-users.md#adding_and_managing_media_portal_users).

**4. Manage FTP accounts**

You can have separate FTP accounts that are associated with Media Portal and mapped to a specific folder in your Dynamic Media Classic account. This kind of functionality means you can allow users to upload digital assets into your account using separate FTP accounts.

See [Managing FTP accounts](ftp-accounts.md#managing_ftp_accounts).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only Media Portal Administrators can administer these FTP accounts . In addition, only users with the role of Media Portal Contributor-User or Media Portal Contributor can upload files.

See [Media Portal user roles](media-portal-user-roles.md#media_portal_user_roles).

**5. Specify export options**

Media Portal users, when they export files, can reformat the files and export original master files — if you give them permission to do that. As an administrator, you decide how users export files.

See [Specifying export options available to Media Portal users](specifying-export-options-available-media.md#specifying_export_options_available_to_media_portal_users).

**6. Create Image Presets**

An Image Preset is a collection of pre-defined settings that change the size, image quality, format, resolution, and other aspects of an image’s appearance when it is exported. You can create Image Presets to control how images are reformatted when users export them.

See [Creating and enabling Image Presets](creating-enabling-image-presets.md#creating_and_enabling_image_presets).

**7. Create metadata presets and user-defined metadata fields**

Metadata describes and identifies a file; it is used for searching for and organizing assets. To make sure that metadata is entered correctly and that metadata fields that require data are filled in, you can create metadata presets. A metadata preset is a pre-defined set of metadata entries. You can also create metadata fields that uniquely describe the files you work with.

See [Making more efficient use of metadata](making-efficient-metadata.md#making_more_efficient_use_of_metadata).

**8. Customize the Media Portal screen**

Media Portal style settings allow you to brand the Media Portal screen with your company logo and colors. Use the style settings to put your company stamp on Media Portal.

See [Customizing the Media Portal screen](customizing-media-portal-screen.md#customizing_the_media_portal_screen).
