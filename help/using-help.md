# Using Help{#using-help}

Adobe Scene7 offers the Help program and onscreen Help.

## Help program {#help-program}

The Scene7 Help system is designed to direct you to information for completing all tasks. To access Help in the Scene7 Publishing System, choose Help &gt; Help on This Topic. The Help system opens to a page that explains the Scene7 screen you are currently viewing. Choose Help &gt; Help Contents to open the Help program to its table of contents.

To use the Help program:

**Contents search** Click the Plus icon next to content titles and subtitles to find information. You can click the Minus icon to collapse subtitles.

**Search by keyword** Enter a search term in the Search box. You see a list of pages from the Help system with the word you entered. Select a page to open it.

**Hypertext link cross-references** Throughout the Help system are many hypertext link cross-references. Select a hypertext link to open the Help program to a page with more information or background information about the task you want to do.

For information about getting technical support from Scene7, choose Help &gt; Support.

## Onscreen Help {#onscreen-help}

Scene7 offers onscreen Help:

**Tool tips** You see a tool tip when you move the cursor over buttons, menus, and navigation links. Tool tips tell you the names of these onscreen items so you can identify them quickly.

**Onscreen instructions** Some screens present getting-started instructions in the form of a text overlay that explains how to accomplish a task. In addition, some screens also offer these icons:

**Instructions icon** Click the Info Tip icon to read brief task instructions.

**Question Mark icon** Click the Question Mark icon next to specific buttons or controls to get an explanation of a button or control.
