# Make more efficient use of metadata{#making-more-efficient-use-of-metadata}

All files on Adobe Dynamic Media Classic contain metadata. Metadata describes and identifies a file; it is used for searching for and organizing assets. To view an assetâ€™s metadata, open it in Detail View and examine the Metadata panel. The metadata fields on this panel provide descriptive information about the asset.

Metadata is not useful in searches and asset organization unless it is entered correctly in metadata fields. To enter metadata correctly and to make sure that all the right metadata fields contain metadata, you can create metadata presets. A *metadata preset* is a pre-defined set of metadata entries. Rather than enter metadata themselves, users can, in Detail View, choose a metadata preset to fill metadata fields with predefined information.

To create metadata presets, see [Metadata Presets](application-setup.md#metadata_presets).

To create metadata fields that uniquely describe the assets you work with, see [User-Defined Fields](application-setup.md#user_defined_fields).
