# Publish eCatalogs and associated PDFs{#publishing-ecatalogs-and-associated-pdfs}

Publishing places your eCatalog and PDF on Dynamic Media Image Servers so it can be made available to your web site or application. As part of the publishing process, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates the URL string. You can place this URL string in your HTML web page code.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure your eCatalog and PDF reside in the same folder and they are marked for publish in the Browse Panel or Asset Details page before you publish them.

**To publish eCatalogs and associated PDFs:**

1. On the Global Navigation bar, select **[!UICONTROL Publish]**.
1. On the Publish screen, select **[!UICONTROL One-Time]** or **[!UICONTROL Recurring]**.
1. (Optional) In the Job Name field, enter a name for the publish job, but keep the predefined date and time text.

   If you set up your eCatalog so that viewers can perform keyword searches, make sure that the keyword data is published. On the Publish dialog box, select **[!UICONTROL Advanced]**. From the **[!UICONTROL Publish]** drop-down menu, select **[!UICONTROL Full w/ Search Data]**. This option is selected by default.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.
