# Link URLs to your web application{#linking-urls-to-your-web-application}

Your web sites and applications access Dynamic Media Image Server content by way of URL strings. After you publish an image, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates a URL string that references the Image Preset on Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can paste these URLs into a web browser for testing.

To place these URL strings in your web pages and applications, copy them from Adobe Dynamic Media Classic. To obtain a URL string generated with an Image Preset, go to the Preview screen or the Browse Panel (in Detail View).

## Obtain an Image Preset URL {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url}

You can obtain a URL string generated by an Image Preset from Preview or from Detail View. After you copy the URL, it lands on the Clipboard so you can paste it as necessary.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

### Obtain an Image Preset URL from Preview {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url-from-preview}

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folder that contains the image asset to preview.
1. Do any one of the following:

    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then below the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Preset List]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Preset List]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**. On the same toolbar, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Preset List]**.

1. (Optional) In the Image Preset List, in the URL Encoding for Copy URL Generation drop-down list, select the URL encoding to apply to the image asset's URL when it is copied.
1. In the Image Preset List window, in the upper-right area of the preview pane, select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** for the selected preset type.
1. In the lower-right corner of the Image Preset List window, select **[!UICONTROL Close]** to return to the Assets screen.

### Obtain an Image Preset URL from the Browse Panel {#obtaining-an-image-preset-url-from-the-browse-panel}

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folder that contains the image asset you want to preview.
1. Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, select a single image asset.
1. Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL URLs]** on the panel on the right side of the screen so you can unfold the list of Image Presets.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** link next to the name of the Image Preset with the URL you want to copy to the Clipboard.

## About Image Preset URL strings {#about-image-preset-url-strings}

A URL call for Image Sizing to Dynamic Media Image Servers has the following basic syntax:

*path*/*name of Image Server*/*account name*/*image name*?*modifier1*&*modifier2*&...

In a Dynamic Media Image Server URL, instructions to the server for displaying the image appear after the question mark (?). For example, this URL call delivers an image named "backpack" at a width of 250 pixels:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?wid=250
```

An Image Preset URL contains all the modifier instructions for presenting the image at the proper size and formatting specifications. Without an Image Preset, notice all the modifier instructions after the question mark (?) in this URL string:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?wid=250&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80,0&resMode=sharp&op_usm=1.1,0.5,1,0
```

However, in a URL string generated with an Image Preset, the name of the Image Preset appears in place of the instructions defined by the Image Preset. For example, referring to the long URL above, the URL string is:

```as3
https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack?$Large$
```

Image Preset names in URLs are enclosed in dollar signs ($). When a Dynamic Media Image Server encounters the Image Preset portion of the URL (the `Large` in this case), using the size and formatting instructions defined by the "Large" Image Preset.

## Add dynamic images to your web page {#adding-dynamic-images-to-your-web-page}

To add dynamic images to your web page, the `<IMG>` tag in your HTML web page code typically is modified using the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic URL string to make a request to Dynamic Media Image Servers. This string produces the image at the size and formatting specifications defined by the Image Preset.

For example, instead of the typical call to open a static image such as

```as3
img src="/company_images/products/backpack_thumbnail.jpg"
```

You now use the `<IMG>`tag to replace the reference to a static image with an Image Preset call to the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic platform. A sample call looks like this:

```as3
img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/S7learn/backpack_trns?$thumbnail$"
```

In this example, a Dynamic Media Image Server "looks up" the definition of `$thumbnail$` and dynamically generates the appropriate image with the sizing and formatting specifications defined by the `thumbnail`Image Preset. In a URL string, all items except the product image filename ( `backpack_trns` in this case) are typically hardwired for the page template. The only element that is automatically inserted in the page template from your commerce server is the IPS ID or name of the image.
