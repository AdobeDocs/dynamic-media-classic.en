# Configure Adobe Analytics reports{#configuring-adobe-analytics-reports}

To tell Adobe Analytics what information that you want in Adobe Analytics reports, go to the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen. After you configure reports, this screen lists, for each viewer event you want information about, a corresponding Adobe Analytics variable and Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variable. These viewer events-Adobe Analytics variable-Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variable combinations determine what information is reported.

Besides associating viewer events with variables, the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen offers tools for activating, editing, and deleting viewer events.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Whenever you change Adobe Analytics Report settings within Adobe Analytics, be sure you log back on to Adobe Analytics from within Adobe Dynamic Media Classic, resave your Adobe Analytics configuration settings, and then republish.

See [Log in to Adobe Analytics](log-analytics.md#log_in_to_adobe_analytics).

See [Publish configuration information](publishing-analytics-configuration-information.md#publishing_adobe_analytics_configuration_information).

## Assign Adobe Analytics variables to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic viewer events and variables {#assigning-adobe-analytics-variables-to-scene-viewer-events-and-variables}

Use the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen to associate viewer events with Adobe Analytics variables and Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variables. For each viewer event, choose one Adobe Analytics variable and one Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variable. For instructions about opening the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen, see [Log in to Adobe Analytics](log-analytics.md#log_in_to_adobe_analytics).

**To assign Adobe Analytics variables to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic viewer events and variables:**

1. After you log in to Adobe Analytics from within Adobe Dynamic Media Classic and select a report suite, on the Adobe Analytics Configuration page, in the right table column, activate a viewer event by selecting **[!UICONTROL Enable]**.
1. Under the Variables column, display the variable pair chooser by selecting the arrow button for the desired Viewer Event.

   See [Viewer events](configuring-analytics-reports.md#viewer_events).

1. Add an Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variable.

   See [Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variables](configuring-analytics-reports.md#scene7_variables).

1. Add an Adobe Analytics variable.
1. (Optional) To add another variable pair, select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   After you select **[!UICONTROL Save]**, the viewer event, its Adobe Analytics variable, and its Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variable, are listed in the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen.

1. In the lower right corner, select **[!UICONTROL Close]**.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Publish]** > **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]** to run an Image Serving publish.

   Publishing is necessary so that the information contained in the viewers is available on Adobe Dynamic Media Classic servers.

### Viewer events {#viewer-events}

Viewer events describe actions that users perform with Adobe Dynamic Media Classic viewers. When a user initiates a certain action, such as selecting a thumbnail or starting or stopping a video, the viewer “broadcasts” an event to the web page, along with data associated with that event.

The following table describes viewer events that you can add to the Adobe Analytics Configuration screen.

|Viewer event|HTML5 Viewer Platform support and viewers|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOAD | **X** (eCatalog, Flyout, SpinSet, Video, Zoom) | When a user starts a viewer |
| PAGE | **X**  (eCatalog) | In eCatalogs, when a user turns a page; in targeted zoom viewers, when a user selects a different target or a color swatch. |
|SWAP| **X**  (eCatalog, Flyout, SpinSet, Video, Zoom) | When a user selects a different thumbnail to view a different image. |
| ITEM | **X**  (eCatalog) | In viewers that support Image Maps in which rollovers are defined, when a user hovers the pointer over an Image Map to read the rollover text. |

### Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variables {#scene-variables}

Adobe Dynamic Media Classic variables represent data that you can obtain for a report. For example, the `searchTerm` variable lists keywords used in eCatalog searches.
