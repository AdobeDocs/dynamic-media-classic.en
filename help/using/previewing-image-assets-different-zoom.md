# Preview image assets with different Zoom Viewers{#previewing-image-assets-with-different-zoom-viewers}

On the Viewer List screen, you can preview images using different Zoom Viewer Presets.

See [Configure default viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

See [Preview an asset](previewing-asset.md#previewing_an_asset).

**To preview image assets with different Zoom Viewers:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, in the Show drop-down list, select an image-based asset type such as Image or Image Set.
1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate the Asset folders that contain images that you want to preview with a Zoom Viewer.
1. Do one of the following:

   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, below the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.
   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset window, select an asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.
   * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**. On the same toolbar, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer List]**.

1. In the Viewer List window, in the table, select a viewer link to preview the asset in the selected viewer.
1. Close the displayed viewer.
