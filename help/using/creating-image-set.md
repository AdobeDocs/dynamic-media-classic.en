# Create an Image Set{#creating-an-image-set}

To create a multiple-view Image Set, you need images that show an item from different points of view or show different aspects of the same item. The goal is to present viewers with images of an item so they get a solid idea of what an item looks like or does.

## Create an Image Set {#create}

When you create a set, the **[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** option affects the set and set members in the following ways:

|**[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** option selected before saving?|State of set after saving|State of set members after saving|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | Published | Published |
| No | Unpublished | Set members retain their published or unpublished state. |

See also [Manually publishing assets](publishing-files.md#manually_publishing_assets) and [Manually unpublishing assets](publishing-files.md#manually_unpublishing_assets).

When you create an Image Set, Adobe recommends the following best practices and enforces the following limits:

| Limit type | Best practice | Limit imposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of duplicate assets per set | No duplicates | 20 |
| Maximum number of images per set | 5-10 images per set  | 1000 |

See also [Dynamic Media limitations](/help/using/limitations.md).

**To create an Image Set:**

1. Do one of the following:

   * **Select the images first** - In the Browse Panel, select the images you want for your Image Set, go to **[!UICONTROL Build]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Sets]**.

   * **Start from the Image Set screen** - Go to **[!UICONTROL Build]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Sets]**. The Image Set screen opens. Select a folder in the Asset Library and drag the images you want for your Image Set onto the Image Set screen.

1. To change the order of images, drag the images to new locations.
1. Near the lower-right corner of the page, ensure that **[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** is selected (default).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**, select a folder for storing your Image Set, enter a name for the set, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. To see your Image Set in the Image Set Viewer, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** on the Image Set screen. You can select swatch thumbnails in the Image Set Viewer to see how they behave.

## Edit an Image Set {#editing-an-image-set}

Whether you edit a published or an unpublished set, the **[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** option affects the set and set members in the following ways:

|Set already published?|**[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** option selected before saving your edit?|State of set after saving|State of set members after saving|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Yes | Yes | Published|Published |
| Yes | No | Published|Existing set members retain their published state. Any new set members that you added during your edit retain their published or unpublished state. |
| No | Yes | Published|Published |
| No | No | Unpublished|Existing set members and any new set members that you added during your edit retain their published or unpublished state. |

**To edit an Image Set:**

1. In the Grid View, browse to an ImageSet, and then below the image, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.
1. Do any of the following:

    * To add an image (published or unpublished), drag it from a folder in Add Assets onto the Image Set’s **[!UICONTROL Views]** page.
    * To remove an image, select it, and then select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** on the toolbar.
    * To reorder images, drag an image to a new position.

1. When you are finished editing the set, near the lower-right corner of the page, ensure that **[!UICONTROL Publish after save]** is selected (default).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**, select a storage folder for your set, enter a name for the set, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Delete an Image Set {#deleting-an-image-set}

When you delete a set, the set itself is moved to the Trash. However, the members (or “children”) within that set are not affected; instead, they each retain their existing published or unpublished state.

See also [Manually publishing assets](publishing-files.md#manually_publishing_assets) and [Manually unpublishing assets](publishing-files.md#manually_unpublishing_assets).

**To delete an Image Set:**

1. In the Grid View, List View, or Details View, select one Image Set or more.
1. On the Global Navigation Bar, go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Delete]** > **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
