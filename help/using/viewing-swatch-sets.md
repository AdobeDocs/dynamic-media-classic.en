## Preview Swatch Sets in a Viewer {#previewing-swatch-sets-in-a-viewer}

You can use Preview to see how an asset appears in a particular viewer type such as HTML5. Depending on the asset type and associated viewer that you have selected to preview, not all viewer type platforms are available in Preview.

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, in the **[!UICONTROL Show]** drop-down list, select a Swatch Set-based asset type such as **[!UICONTROL Swatch Set]**.
1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate the Asset folders that contain Swatch Set that you want to preview with a viewer.
1. Do any one of the following:

    * Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic window, select the **[!UICONTROL List View]** icon. In the Asset window, hover on an asset, then select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** (not the Preview drop-down list).
    * Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic window, select the **[!UICONTROL Grid View]** icon. In the Asset window, in an asset thumbnail window, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** (not the Preview drop-down list).
    * Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic window, select the **[!UICONTROL Detail View]** icon. On the same toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** (not the Preview drop-down list).

1. (Optional) In the Preview window, in the drop-down list at the bottom, select the URL encoding to apply to the asset's URL when it is copied.
1. To preview the asset in the selected viewer, select a viewer link.

   When you select a given viewer link, its associated URL is automatically copied to the clipboard.
