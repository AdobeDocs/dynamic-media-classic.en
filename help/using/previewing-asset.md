# Preview an asset{#previewing-an-asset}

You can use Preview to see how a digital asset appears when viewed by a customer. The Preview uses the default viewer that is assigned to the asset. Default viewers are configured in Application Setup.

See [Configure default viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

If you are previewing a template asset with parameter layers, you can change parameters or change the image preset. Because your changes are made inline, you can view the results immediately from the same Preview window.

See also [Adobe Viewers Reference Library Examples](https://landing.adobe.com/en/na/dynamic-media/ctir-2755/live-demos.html).

**To preview an asset:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folders that contains the asset you want to preview.
1. Do any one of the following:

    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**.

1. Depending on the view that you are using, do one of the following:

    * In the Asset window of the Grid View or List View, select a single asset, and then select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** near the thumbnail image.
    * On the toolbar above the Assets window of the Grid View, List View, or Detail View, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

## Preview an asset based on viewer platform type {#previewing-an-asset-based-on-viewer-platform-type}

You can use Viewer List to preview how an asset appears on particular viewer platform type such as HTML5. Depending on the asset type and the associated viewer that you have selected to preview, not all platforms are available in Viewer List.

You can also use Viewer List to copy a viewer’s URL or view and copy the viewer code for embedding in your web pages.

For a given viewer platform, the Viewer List window lets you visually see what devices, such as tablets and Smartphones, that a viewer is available for use.

**To preview an asset based on viewer platform type:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folders that contains the asset you want to preview.
1. Do any one of the following:

## Preview an image asset based on its Image Preset {#previewing-an-image-asset-based-on-its-image-preset}

You can preview an image asset based on its Image Preset to find out what your image looks like when it is delivered dynamically to your web site or application at different sizes.

An Image Preset is a collection of pre-defined settings that change the size, image quality, format, resolution, and other aspects of an image’s appearance when it is exported.

See [Set up Image Presets](setting-image-presets.md#setting_up_image_presets).

See [Create and enable Image Presets](creating-enabling-image-presets.md#creating_and_enabling_image_presets).

**To preview an image asset based on its Image Preset:**

1. In the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the Asset folders that contains the image asset you want to preview.
1. Do any one of the following:

    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then below the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Preset List]**.
    * Above the Assets window, on the right side of the toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL List View]**. In the Asset window, select a single image asset, and then to the right of the thumbnail image, go to **[!UICONTROL Preview]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Preset List]**.
