# Set up Spin Set Viewer Presets{#setting-up-spin-set-viewer-presets}

Spin Set Viewer Presets determine the style, behavior, and look of your viewers. Adobe Dynamic Media Classic comes with default Spin Set Viewer Presets. If you are an administrator, you can create your own Spin Set Viewer Presets as well. You can configure a Spin Set Viewer Preset with different colors, borders, fonts, and image settings.

**To create a Spin Set Viewer Preset:**

1. On the Global Navigation bar, go to **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Viewer Presets]**.
1. Do one of the following:

    * To create a preset, select **[!UICONTROL Add]**, then in the Add Viewer Preset dialog box, choose a platform, and then select **[!UICONTROL Spin Set Viewer]**.
    * To edit an existing Spin Set Viewer preset, select the preset, and then select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. On the `Configure Viewer` page, type a name in the Preset Name box for the Spin Set Viewer preset.
1. Specify other options as desired. To see a description of an option, select the **[!UICONTROL Info Tip]** icon next to the option.

   The Preview page displays the viewer as you update and change settings.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Select **[!UICONTROL Make Default]** to make the Spin Set Viewer Preset you created the company default for showing Spin Sets.

See [Configure Default Viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

To delete a Spin Set Viewer Preset, select it on the Viewer Presets page, and then select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
