# Link a Swatch Set to a web page{#linking-a-swatch-set-to-a-web-page}

After you publish a Swatch Set, you can use its associated URL or embed code in your web site or application. Then you can deploy the URL or embed code as necessary so users can view the Swatch Set on your web site or application.

>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copy a Swatch Set URL {#copying-a-swatch-set-url}

1. In the Asset Browse panel, in the Show drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Swatch Set]**.

## Add Swatch Set URLs to your web page {#adding-swatch-set-urls-to-your-web-page}

The most common way to deploy Swatch Sets is to place a link (by way of a navigation icon) on your web page. When selected, the link launches a dynamic page (ASP or JSP) that displays the Swatch Set in a pop-up zoom window. The zoom link opens a pop-up window that contains the actual zoom feature.
