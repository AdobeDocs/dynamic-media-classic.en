# Upload Zoom images{#uploading-zoom-images}

Zoom images must have a high pixel count. A high number of pixels are needed so that viewers can clearly see image details when they zoom images. Make sure that the images that you use are the appropriate size before uploading them to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

On the Global Navigation bar, select **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to begin uploading images.

For detailed instruction on uploading images, see [Upload files](uploading-files.md#uploading_files).

**Prepare your images for zooming:**

To take the best advantage of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic Zoom features, prepare your zoom image files before you upload them:

* **Image size**: Adobe Dynamic Media Classic recommends using image files that are, at minimum, 2000 pixels in the longest size. This way, images can clearly be seen when users zoom them.

* **File formats**: Adobe Dynamic Media Classic supports all standard image file formats. Formats include TIFF, BMP, JPEG, PSD, GIF, and EPS. Lossless image formats&ndash;TIFF and PNG&ndash;are recommended. If you are using a JPEG image, use the highest-quality settings.

* **Color space**: RGB is the color space for Web image presentations; CMYK images are automatically converted to RGB when you upload them. Uploading CMYK images that have an embedded ICC color profile for the conversion to RGB is recommended. See also ICC profiles.
