# Publish a Spin Set{#publishing-a-spin-set}

Publishing a Spin Set places the images in the set on Dynamic Media Image Servers, where they are available to your web site or application. What is more, during the publishing process, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates the Spin Set URL strings you need for your web site or application.

## Mark a Spin Set for publish {#marking-a-spin-set-for-publish}

Mark your Spin Set for publish for it to be copied to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic image servers. You can mark your Spin Set for publish in the Browse Panel by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Mark for Publish]** icon to the left of its name. All images in the set are marked for publish when you mark the Spin Set itself for publish.

## Publish the Spin Set {#publishing-the-spin-set}

To publish a Spin Set to Dynamic Media Image Servers, on the Global Navigation bar, select **[!UICONTROL Publish]**. Then select a **[!UICONTROL When]** option. You can optionally enter a name for the publish job. Select **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.
