Adobe Dynamic Media Classic comes with default Viewer Presets. Administrators can create or modify the Viewer Presets.

    * Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic window, select the **[!UICONTROL Grid View]** icon. In the Asset window, in an asset thumbnail window, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** (not the Preview drop-down list).
    * Near the upper-right corner of the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic window, select the **[!UICONTROL Detail View]** icon. On the same toolbar, select **[!UICONTROL Preview]** (not the Preview drop-down list).

1. (Optional) In the Preview window, in the drop-down list at the bottom, select the URL encoding to apply to the asset's URL when it is copied.
