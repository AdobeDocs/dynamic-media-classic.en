# Link an eCatalog to a Web page{#linking-an-ecatalog-to-a-web-page}

Your Web sites and applications access Dynamic Media Image Server content, including eCatalogs, by way of URL strings or embedded code. These URL strings are activated during the publishing process. To place the URL string or embedded code for your eCatalog in your Web pages and applications, you copy it from Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copy an eCatalog URL {#copying-an-ecatalog-url}

1. In the Asset Browse panel, in the Show drop-down list, select **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**.
1. in the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the asset folder that contains the eCatalog whose embed code you want to copy.

    * Select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**. In the Asset Browse panel, double-click a single asset to open it in Detail View. In the URLs and Embed Code panel on the right, select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** to the right of the viewer you want.

## Add eCatalog URLs to your Web page {#adding-ecatalog-urls-to-your-web-page}

The most common way to deploy an eCatalog is to place a link in the form of an eCatalog thumbnail cover page on your Web page. Work with your IT team to make sure that the eCatalog launches in a clean, centered pop-up window. Ask your IT team to keep the toolbar and address bar in the browser from showing.
