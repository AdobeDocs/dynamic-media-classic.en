# Link a template to a Web page{#linking-a-template-to-a-web-page}

Your Web sites and applications access Dynamic Media Image Server content by way of URL strings. After you publish a template, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates a URL string that references the template on Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can paste this URL in a Web browser for testing.

To place URL strings in your Web pages and applications, copy them from Adobe Dynamic Media Classic. To obtain a Template URL string generated with an Image Preset, go to the Preview screen or the Browse panel (in Detail View). Then select an Image Preset and select the copy URL button.

>[!NOTE]

>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Obtain a template URL {#obtaining-a-template-url}

You can obtain a template URL string generated by an Image Preset from the Template Preview screen. After you copy the URL, it lands on the Clipboard so you can paste it as necessary. To obtain a template URL string generated with an Image Preset from the Template Preview page, do the following:

1. Select the template's rollover **[!UICONTROL Preview]** button or go to **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.
1. Using the Preset's menus, choose the Image Preset with which you want to deliver the template image. The Preview page shows you what the template looks like when it is delivered from the server.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** so you can copy the URL to the Clipboard.

## Add template URLs to your Web page {#adding-template-urls-to-your-web-page}

To add a template to your Web page, consult with your Web page development team to modify the `<IMG>` tag in your HTML Web page code. Use the Adobe Dynamic Media Classic URL string to make a request to Dynamic Media Image Servers. The commerce engine or dynamic Web page code inserts the template image at the size and with the formatting specification defined by the Image Preset you choose for your template.
