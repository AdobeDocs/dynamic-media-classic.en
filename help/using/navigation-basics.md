## Browse Panel/Build Panel {#browse-panel-build-panel}

The Browse/Build Panel is where you do much of your work. The functions that are available in this panel depend on whether you are in Browse mode or Build mode.

* **[!UICONTROL Browse mode]** - To view and work with a folder's contents in the Browse Panel, select a folder in the Asset Library. This panel offers the **[!UICONTROL File]**, **[!UICONTROL Preview]**, **[!UICONTROL Select All]**, **[!UICONTROL Select None]**, and **[!UICONTROL Sort]** menus for working with assets. You can also view assets in different ways by moving the slider or select **[!UICONTROL Grid View]**, **[!UICONTROL List View]**, or **[!UICONTROL Detail View]**.
