# Editing images{#editing-images}

Dynamic Media Classic offers many tools for creating rich-media effects. These tools are available by clicking the rollover Edit button and in the Browse Panel in Detail view. You can do the following image-editing tasks in Dynamic Media Classic:

* **Create Image Maps** - To create an Image Map, select the Image command or **[!UICONTROL Image Map]** button. An Image Map is a hotspot on an image, or an eCatalog page, or an image in a SpinSet, that displays a panel with rollover text. Users can click an Image Map, for example, to launch a new web page. See [Creating Image Maps](/help/creating-image-maps.md).

* **Create Zoom targets** - To create thumbnail targets, select the Zoom Targets command or the **[!UICONTROL Zoom Targets]** button. Users can click a thumbnail target in the Zoom Viewer to zoom directly to a particular part of an image. See [Creating zoom targets for Guided Zoom](/help/creating-zoom-targets-guided-zoom.md).

* **Crop an image** - To crop an image, select the Crop command or the **[!UICONTROL Crop]** button. See [Cropping an image](/help/cropping-image.md).

* **Sharpen an image** - To sharpen an image and make its outlines less blurry and more distinct, select the Sharpen command or the **[!UICONTROL Sharpen]** button. See [Sharpening an image](/help/sharpening-image.md).

* **Adjust an image** - Select the Adjust command or the **[!UICONTROL Adjust]** button to flip, rotate, blur, colorize, or alter the color balance of an image. See [Adjusting an image](/help/adjusting-image.md).

* **Edit layers** - To display individual, editable layers in a PSD file, click the **[!UICONTROL Layers]** tab. When you upload a PSD file, all layers are uploaded individually as separate files so that you can edit them within Dynamic Media Classic.

Besides using these tools to edit images, you can edit images as you upload them to Dynamic Media Classic. For example, you can crop images, create a mask from a clipping path, and select a color profile for an image as you upload it.
