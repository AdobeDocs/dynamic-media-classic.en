# Instrumenting a viewer using the Adobe Analytics Instrumentation Kit{#instrumenting-a-viewer-using-the-adobe-analytics-instrumentation-kit}

You can use the Adobe Analytics Instrumentation Kit to integrate an HTML5 viewer with Adobe Analytics.

If you use any of the predefined Dynamic Media Classic HTML5 viewer presets, they already contain all the implementation code to send data to Adobe Analytics; no further instrumentation is required by you.

## Set up Adobe Analytics tracking from Dynamic Media Classic {#set-up-adobe-analytics-tracking-from-scene-publishing-system}

For all HTML5 viewers, add the following JavaScriptâ„¢ to the HTML container, usually in the &lt;head> element:

```as3
<!-- ***** Adobe Analytics Tracking ***** --><script type="text/javascript" src="https://s7d6.scene7.com/s7viewers/s_code.jsp?company=<Dynamic Media Classic Company ID>&preset=companypreset-1"></script>
```

Where `Dynamic Media Classic Company ID` is set to the Dynamic Media Classic company name. And `&preset` is optional unless the company preset name is not `companypreset`. In such cases, it could be `companypreset-1, companypreset-2`, and so on. The higher number is a newer instance of the preset. To determine the correct company preset value name, click **[!UICONTROL Copy URL]** , and then look at the `preset=`parameter to find the company preset name.

Continuing, now add a function that transmits the viewer event to the Adobe Analytics tracking code.

Add the `s7ComponentEvent()` function to the container HTML (or JSP, or ASPX or other):

```as3
function s7ComponentEvent(objectId, componentClass, instanceName, timeStamp, eventData) {     s7track(eventData); }
```

The function name is case-sensitive. The only parameter passed to `s7componentEvent`that is required is the last one: `eventData`. Where `s7track()` is defined in s_code.jsp included above. And `s7track` handles all tracking per each event. (To further customize data transmitted to Adobe Analytics, this area is the place to do it.)

## Enabling HREF and ITEM events {#enabling-href-and-item-events}

You can enable HREF (rollover) and ITEM (mouse clicks/touch) events in the viewers through Image Map editing. Define the identifiers for the HREF and ITEM within the Image Map that is associated with viewer content. Add a `&rolloverKey=` parameter to the HREF value within the Image Map.
