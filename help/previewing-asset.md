# Previewing an asset{#previewing-an-asset}

You can use Preview to see how a digital asset will look when viewed by a customer. The Preview uses the default viewer that is assigned to the asset. Default viewers are configured in Application Setup.

See [Configuring Default Viewers](application-setup.md#configuring_default_viewers).

If you are previewing a template asset with parameter layers, you can make changes to the parameters or change the image preset. Because your changes are made inline, you can view the results immediately from the same Preview window.

See also [Adobe Viewers Reference Library Examples](https://landing.adobe.com/en/na/dynamic-media/ctir-2755/live-demos.html).
