# Linking an eCatalog to a web page{#linking-an-ecatalog-to-a-web-page}

Your web sites and applications access Scene7 Image Server content, including eCatalogs, by way of URL strings or embedded code. These URL strings are activated during the publishing process. To place the URL string or embedded code for your eCatalog in your web pages and applications, you copy it from the Scene7 Publishing System.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The URL is not active until you publish the asset.

## Copying an eCatalog URL {#copying-an-ecatalog-url}

1. In the Asset Browse panel, in the Show drop-down list, click **Catalog**.
1. in the Asset Library panel on the left side, navigate to the asset folder that contains the eCatalog whose embed code you want to copy.
1. Above the Asset Browse panel, on the right side of the toolbar, do one of the following:

    * Click **Grid View**. In the Asset Browse panel, double-click a single asset to open it in Detail View. In the URLs and Embed Code panel on the right, click **Copy URL** to the right of the viewer you want.
    * Click **Grid View**. In the Asset Browse panel, select a single asset, and then below the thumbnail image, click **Preview** &gt; **Viewer List**.

## Adding eCatalog URLs to your web page {#adding-ecatalog-urls-to-your-web-page}

The most common way to deploy an eCatalog is to place a link in the form of an eCatalog thumbnail cover page on your web page. Work with your IT team to make sure that the eCatalog launches in a clean, centered pop-up window. Ask your IT team to keep the toolbar and address bar in the browser from showing.

For additional details and code samples, see [Embedding HTML5 eCatalog Viewer in the Viewers Reference Guide](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/s7/viewers_ref/c_html5_20_ecatalog_viewer_about.html).
