# Publish master images{#publishing-master-images}

Publishing your image files publishes them to Dynamic Media Image Servers, where they are available to your web site and application. Whatâ€™s more, during the publishing process, Adobe Dynamic Media Classic activates the URL strings you need for your web site and application.

## Mark master images for publish {#marking-master-images-for-publish}

Master images must be marked for publish for them to be copied to Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can mark your master images for publish in the Browse Panel by clicking **[!UICONTROL Mark for Publish]** icon. You can also mark images for publish when you upload them to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic.

## Publish your master images {#publishing-your-master-images}

1. On the Global Navigation bar, select **[!UICONTROL Publish]**. On the Publish dialog box, select a When option (**[!UICONTROL One-Time]** or **[!UICONTROL Recurring]**), then optionally enter a name for the publish job

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Submit Publish]**.
