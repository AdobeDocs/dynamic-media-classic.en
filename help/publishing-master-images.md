# Publishing master images{#publishing-master-images}

Publishing your image files publishes them to Dynamic Media Image Servers, where they are available to your web site and application. Whatâ€™s more, during the publishing process, Dynamic Media Classic activates the URL strings you need for your web site and application.

## Marking master images for publish {#marking-master-images-for-publish}

Master images must be marked for publish in order for them to be copied to Dynamic Media Image Servers. You can mark your master images for publish in the Browse Panel by clicking the Mark for Publish icon. You can also mark images for publish when you upload them to Dynamic Media Classic.

## Publishing your master images {#publishing-your-master-images}

To publish master images to Dynamic Media Image Servers, start by selecting the Publish button on the Global Navigation bar. Then select a When option (One-Time or Recurring), optionally enter a name for the publish job, and select the Start Publish button.
