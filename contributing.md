# Contribute to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic Documentation

Thank you for choosing to contribute to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic documentation! Adobe welcomes content contributions from the entire reader community and from fellow Adobe employees.

This file describes how you can contribute, and shows you the guidelines to follow when making your contributions.

## Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Adobe Open Source Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By contributing to the documentation, you agree to adhere to this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to [Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com).

## Guidelines for contributing

While Adobe welcomes any contributions to improve the documentation, be sure that what you contribute adheres to certain guidelines and standards where possible. Please review the [Guidelines for Contributing to Adobe Dynamic Media Classic Documentation](guidelines.md) for more information.

## How to contribute

Adobe wants to make it as easy as possible to submit your contributions. You can contribute in two ways:

* [Create an issue](#create-an-issue)
* [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request)

Which method you choose depends on how comfortable you are editing the documentation in GitHub yourself.

>Contributions that you submit are covered by the [Adobe terms of use.](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html)

### Create an issue {#create-an-issue}

Do you have a suggestion, observation about the current docs, or question the way something is described? Then please create an issue. Issues are also excellent if you have something to contribute, but do not feel comfortable editing the docs or making a pull request yourself.

Issues let you easily describe your idea for improvement to the docs and a documentation team member can review it. To create an issue, select **[!UICONTROL Log an issue]** at the top of the right navigation panel on any page.

### Create a pull request {#create-a-pull-request}

If you see a problem and know exactly how to fix it, consider creating a pull request. Pull requests allow you to make your own edits to the documentation, which are then reviewed for inclusion by a documentation team member. To make your suggested changes and create the pull request, select **[!UICONTROL Edit this page]** at the top right of the navigation panel on any page.

All pull requests must be accompanied by a signed [contributor license agreement or CLA](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html). This workflow gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. You only submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are set.

### Quick video introduction

Have a look at the following video for a quick overview of how to create issues and pull requests.

### Contributions from Adobe Employees

If you are an Adobe employee and have a contribution, please use the `AdobeDocs` org in the corporate git.

Adobe welcomes any contribution. Contributions are reviewed if it is made on the public repository. However, pull requests from Adobe employees are easier to process and are approved faster on the corporate repository. Make sure that any proprietary information is only discussed on the corporate repository.
